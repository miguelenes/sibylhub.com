# Post-load RSS decay runner (api7/aisix#968): after a burst of large-payload
# traffic stops, does the gateway hand freed pages back to the OS, or does
# RSS ratchet at the burst peak? One saturating burst of BENCH_DECAY_BODY_KB
# bodies, then BENCH_DECAY_S seconds of idle sampling (VmRSS/VmHWM at ~2 Hz,
# smaps_rollup Pss/LazyFree at ~1 Hz), all appended to results.jsonl by
# decay_leg in lib.sh.
#
# Deliberately a separate runner rather than a run-baseline.sh tier: the large
# bodies drive VmHWM far above anything the baseline grid produces, and a
# shared process lifetime would poison meta.json's rss_hwm_kb against every
# historical baseline. This runner gets a fresh gateway, its own idle anchor,
# and its own meta.json.

# refused, not leak into the JSONL as non-numeric fields. The body cap is a
# transport limit, not a taste choice: the body travels to otb as one argv
# string and Linux MAX_ARG_STRLEN is 128 KiB, so MB-scale bodies need an
# @file mode in otb first (out of scope for #968; 126 leaves room for the
