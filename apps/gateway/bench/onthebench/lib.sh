# Shared measurement core for the onthebench-style harness. Sourced by
# run-baseline.sh (the sibyl-gateway baseline) and run-entrant.sh (any target
# process). Every reported number comes out of the same functions here, so
# two runs are comparable by construction instead of by code review.
#
# Contract: the sourcing runner calls bench_init after setting OUT, starts
# the measured process itself, and leaves its pid in GW_PID. Method knobs
# are env-overridable (BENCH_*) so a spot-check or an extra delay tier is
# an invocation, not a script edit; every default below is exactly what
# run-baseline.sh has always run (the api7/sibyl-gateway#891 grid).
