# On-rig baseline runner, replicating the onthebench methodology on our own box:
# 16-core m7g.4xlarge split into three disjoint pinned groups — gateway 4 cores,
# load generator 6, mock upstream 6 — default shipped config, local mock, fixed
# concurrency grid, 25s windows, >=4 valid (fail=0) repetitions per point.
#
# Usage: run-baseline.sh <sibyl-gateway-src-dir> <out-dir>
#
# The default grid (ttft_ms:concurrency): 0:16 0:32 0:128 10:768 — the same
# grid as the api7/sibyl-gateway#891 A/B tables. BENCH_GRID / BENCH_REPS / the other
# BENCH_* knobs in lib.sh override it, so a two-window spot-check or an extra
# delay tier is an invocation, not a script edit. The rig floor (loadgen
# driving the mock directly) is recorded per tier so gateway numbers can
# always be checked against the instrument's own ceiling. One on-CPU
# flamegraph is taken at the 0-delay c=128 saturation point when the grid has
# one (perf -> inferno, the #847 workflow).
