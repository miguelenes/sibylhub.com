#!/usr/bin/env bash
# On-rig runner for ANY gateway-shaped process ("entrant"): same instruments,
# same core split, same windows, floors and validity policy as run-baseline.sh
# measures sibyl-gateway — both source lib.sh, so a cross-target comparison is
# apples-to-apples by construction.
#
# Usage: run-entrant.sh <entrant-dir> <out-dir>
#
# <entrant-dir>/entrant.sh is sourced (before lib.sh, so it can override the
# request shape) and must provide:
#
#   ENTRANT_NAME             short identifier stamped into results and meta
#   entrant_start <out-dir>  boot the target listening on 127.0.0.1:$GW_PORT,
#                            upstream pointed at 127.0.0.1:$MOCK_PORT, pinned
#                            to $GW_CORES; must set GW_PID to the pid whose
#                            /proc CPU and RSS are sampled
#
# and may provide:
#
#   entrant_prepare <out-dir>  one-time fetch/build, before any measurement
#   entrant_stop               teardown beyond `kill $GW_PID` (containers);
#                            must tolerate being called when entrant_start
#                            never ran (cleanup on a prepare failure)
#   entrant_meta_json          extra identity JSON object (version, digest, …)
#   REQ_PATH / BODY / AUTH_HEADER  request shape, when the entrant's ingress
#                            speaks a dialect other than OpenAI chat
#
# entrant.sh is sourced before lib.sh: harness variables (GW_PORT, GW_CORES,
# MOCK_PORT, ...) are available inside the hook functions when they are
# called, but NOT at the entrant.sh top level.
#
# The entrant dir itself is deliberately not part of this repository: the
# harness carries the method; what it points at is the operator's business.
#
# Flamegraphs default OFF here (BENCH_FLAMEGRAPH=1 opts in): most shipped
# release binaries are stripped, and a symbol-less flamegraph is noise. A
# stripped binary skips the flamegraph with a warning instead of failing the
# run — the throughput numbers stand on their own.
