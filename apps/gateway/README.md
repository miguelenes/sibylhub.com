---

**SibylHub Gateway** is a Rust-native gateway that puts a single, OpenAI-compatible API in
front of every LLM provider — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI,
DeepSeek, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. It gives platform teams one place to route,
govern, secure, and observe LLM traffic, with first-class SSE streaming and low gateway
overhead.

It runs as a **single static binary** — low cold-start, lock-free config reads, and hot
configuration reloads with no restarts: declare resources in one `resources.yaml` and
reload on `SIGHUP`, or point the gateway at etcd for a multi-replica cluster. Run the
open-source gateway in your infrastructure, or connect it to
**[AISIX Cloud](https://api7.ai/ai-gateway?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cloud)**
for centralized management with team governance, budgets, audit, and a dashboard.

> **SibylHub Gateway (this repo)** is the open-source product. It runs without a control
> plane using declarative configuration or etcd. When connected to
> **[AISIX Cloud](https://api7.ai/ai-gateway?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cloud)**,
> the same gateway serves as the data plane. AISIX Cloud adds a commercial control plane,
> either hosted by API7 (**Hybrid Cloud**) or hosted by you in your infrastructure
> (**On-Premises**). In both options, the gateway runs in your environment and calls
> providers directly; live AI traffic does not pass through the control plane or API7.
> The proxy API is identical throughout.

## ⚡ Quickstart

One container. No control plane, no database, no configuration store — the gateway reads
every dynamic resource from one declarative `resources.yaml`.

```yaml
# config.yaml
resources_file: /etc/sibyl-gateway/resources.yaml
proxy:
  addr: "0.0.0.0:3000"
admin:
  enabled: false          # a declarative gateway needs no admin listener
observability:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
      addr: "0.0.0.0:9090"
```

```yaml
# resources.yaml
_format_version: "1"

provider_keys:
  - display_name: openai-main
    provider: openai
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}        # interpolated from the environment

models:
  - display_name: my-model
    provider: openai
    model_name: gpt-4o-mini
    provider_key: openai-main

api_keys:
  - display_name: local-dev
    key_env: CALLER_API_KEY           # hashed at load; the plaintext is never stored
    allowed_models: ["my-model"]
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_PROVIDER_KEY"
export CALLER_API_KEY="YOUR_CALLER_KEY"

docker run -d --name sibyl-gateway \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/etc/sibyl-gateway/config.yaml:ro" \
  -v "$(pwd)/resources.yaml:/etc/sibyl-gateway/resources.yaml:ro" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY -e CALLER_API_KEY \
  -p 3000:3000 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 \
  ghcr.io/api7/sibyl-gateway:latest        # proxy → :3000, metrics + status → :9090
#                                  ^ the metrics/status listener is unauthenticated;
#                                    keep it on loopback or a private network
```

Then call the gateway exactly like OpenAI:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CALLER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"my-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
```

Edit `resources.yaml` and send `SIGHUP` (`docker kill -s HUP sibyl-gateway`) to apply changes with
no restart — an invalid file is rejected whole and the last good configuration keeps
serving. Check a file before booting with `sibyl-gateway validate --resources resources.yaml`.

Full walkthrough: the
[Gateway Quickstart](https://docs.api7.ai/ai-gateway/getting-started/gateway-quickstart) ·
every field: the [resources file reference](https://docs.api7.ai/ai-gateway/reference/resources-file).
For a multi-replica cluster, point the gateway at etcd instead — `resources_file` and
`etcd` are mutually exclusive.

## ✨ Why SibylHub Gateway

- **One API, every model.** Speak the OpenAI *or* Anthropic wire format in; the gateway
  translates to whichever provider each model points at. Point an OpenAI or Claude SDK at
  one `base_url` and switch models without changing code.
- **A real gateway, in Rust.** Single static binary, low cold-start, lock-free config reads
  on the hot path, native streaming.
- **Open source, free forever.** Apache-2.0 licensed and built to run in your
  infrastructure. Choose AISIX Cloud when you want centralized management through a
  control plane and dashboard.
- **Production controls built in.** Routing & failover, rate limits, guardrails, caching,
  and observability ship in the box. (Budgets and spend caps are an AISIX Cloud feature —
  the gateway enforces the control plane's decisions.)

## 🧩 Features — available today

Covered by 183 end-to-end scenario files (496 cases) that run against real gateway processes.

- **OpenAI-compatible proxy** (`:3000`) — `chat/completions`, `completions`, `responses`,
  `embeddings`, `rerank`, `images/{generations,edits}`, `audio/{speech,transcriptions,translations}`,
  `videos` (submit → poll → fetch), `files`, `batches`, `fine_tuning/jobs`, `realtime`,
  `GET /v1/models`, plus a root-level `/passthrough/:provider/*` escape hatch. Native SSE streaming,
  tool/function calling, JSON mode, vision/multimodal input, and reasoning-content support.
- **Anthropic Messages API** — `POST /v1/messages` as a first-class route, working against
  **any** configured upstream: requests and responses (including streaming) are translated
  both ways when a model points at a non-Anthropic provider.
- **Routing & failover** — virtual/routing models with six strategies: `round_robin`
  (smooth weighted round-robin), `consistent_hash` (session affinity keyed by header /
  cookie / API key / client IP), `failover`, plus metric-based `least_cost`,
  `least_latency`, and `least_busy`. Per-target `priority` tiers (active/backup pools),
  retry budgets, cooldowns, tag-conditional targets, and per-attempt timeouts.
- **Ensemble models** — fan one request out to a panel of models concurrently, then have a
  judge model synthesize a single answer, with a minimum-successful-responses threshold.
- **Semantic routing** — one virtual model that dispatches by the *meaning* of each
  request: it embeds the prompt, scores it against per-route example utterances, and routes
  to the best match (or a default). See the
  [semantic routing docs](https://docs.api7.ai/ai-gateway/routing/semantic-routing).
- **Rate limiting & concurrency** — RPS/RPM/RPH/RPD + TPM/TPD + concurrency caps,
  AND-combined across caller keys, models, and policy scopes (`api_key` / `model` / `team` /
  `member` / `team_member`). Counters are per-process by default, or shared across replicas
  with the Redis backend.
- **Guardrails** — content-policy enforcement on input and output, in-process or through a
  provider: keyword/regex, built-in PII detection and redaction, Presidio, Lakera, OpenAI
  Moderation, AWS Bedrock Guardrails, Azure AI Content Safety (Prompt Shield + text
  moderation), and two Alibaba Cloud services. A block returns `422 content_filter`;
  monitor mode records what would have happened without blocking.
- **Caching** — exact-match response cache with per-policy TTL and model/key scope matchers;
  memory and Redis backends; cost-saved telemetry on every hit. Separately, **automatic
  prompt caching** can be enabled per direct Anthropic model to inject cache breakpoints, so
  callers get provider-side prompt discounts without changing their requests.
- **MCP gateway** — front registered upstream MCP servers at `/mcp` with gateway-held
  credentials, per-server tool namespaces, and per-caller access. It serves every
  Streamable HTTP revision from `2025-03-26` through stateless `2026-07-28` without
  downstream sessions. Upstreams use `initialize` by default or `server/discover` with
  `protocol_version: "2026-07-28"`. CI runs the official MCP suite's applicable tools-only
  protocol scenarios. Also exposes a REST API as MCP tools from its OpenAPI description.
- **A2A agent gateway** — front A2A (Agent-to-Agent) agents at `/a2a/:agent`, serving each
  agent's card with URLs rewritten to the gateway, over JSON-RPC 2.0.
- **Inbound authentication** — caller API keys (SHA-256 hashed, model allowlists, expiry,
  rotation), or OIDC/JWT bearer tokens validated against registered providers (Entra ID,
  Okta, Google Workspace, or any OIDC issuer) with JWKS caching.
- **Observability** — Prometheus `/metrics`, structured per-request access logs, usage
  events, OTLP/GenAI span export (Langfuse, Honeycomb, Grafana Cloud, or any OTLP receiver),
  plus dedicated Datadog and Aliyun SLS log exporters and object-storage (S3/GCS/Azure Blob)
  telemetry.
- **Declarative configuration** — one `resources.yaml` carries all ten resource collections
  (provider keys, models, caller keys, guardrails, MCP servers, A2A agents, cache policies,
  observability exporters, rate-limit policies, OIDC providers), validated against the same
  JSON Schemas the gateway uses at runtime. `sibyl-gateway validate` checks a file offline; `SIGHUP`
  reloads it atomically.
- **Operational endpoints** — `/livez` and `/readyz` on the proxy listener; `/status/config`,
  `/status/ready`, `/status/models`, and Prometheus `/metrics` on a dedicated metrics
  listener (`:9090`). The admin listener (`:3001`) additionally serves a **read-only**
  resource surface, OpenAPI 3 with a Scalar UI, and a playground. Resources are managed
  declaratively — through the `resources_file` (reloaded on SIGHUP) or direct etcd
  writes — not through the admin listener; its former write endpoints were removed.

## 🔌 Supported providers

SibylHub Gateway dispatches through **five native adapter families** — distinct wire-protocol bridges,
not one generic relabel. Whatever the upstream protocol, the client-facing API stays
OpenAI-shaped.

| Adapter family | Reaches | Wire shape · auth |
|---|---|---|
| `openai` | OpenAI **+ any OpenAI-compatible vendor** — DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, Together, Fireworks, Perplexity, vLLM, Ollama, or self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoints | OpenAI chat completions · Bearer |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic Claude | Anthropic Messages · `x-api-key` |
| `bedrock` | AWS Bedrock — Anthropic, Meta Llama, Mistral, Cohere, Amazon Titan/Nova, AI21 | Bedrock Converse + `/invoke` · SigV4 |
| `vertex` | Google Vertex AI (Gemini) | Vertex `:generateContent` · OAuth2 |
| `azure-openai` | Azure OpenAI | Azure deployments · api-key / Entra ID |

Plus specialized handling for vendor quirks (e.g. DeepSeek reasoning content) and dedicated
**rerank / embeddings** vendors (Cohere, Jina). Details in
[adapter protocol families](https://docs.api7.ai/ai-gateway/providers/adapters).

## ☁️ Open source vs AISIX Cloud

Same gateway binary, same proxy API — in every form the gateway runs in your environment.
**AISIX Cloud** adds a commercial control plane, either hosted by API7
(**Hybrid Cloud**) or hosted in your infrastructure (**On-Premises**).

## 🏗️ Architecture

A single Cargo workspace; the `sibyl-gateway-server` crate builds one binary named `sibyl-gateway` that
wires the crates together.

```

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Highlights on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md); tracked live in
[issues](https://github.com/api7/sibyl-gateway/issues):

- Semantic (embedding-similarity) response caching
- More observability sinks — Langsmith, Helicone, Slack alerts
- Prompt templates managed as gateway resources
- Llama-Guard as a guardrail provider

Shipped since this list was last written: the MCP gateway, the A2A agent gateway,
OIDC/JWT inbound auth, Redis-backed distributed rate limiting, and the Lakera, Presidio,
PII, and OpenAI Moderation guardrails — see **Features** above.

## 🛠️ Development

Prerequisites: the Rust toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. Docker is only needed
for the tests that exercise etcd, Redis, or provider emulators.

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace

# Coverage (matches the CI gate)
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --lcov --output-path lcov.info

# Run locally against a resources.yaml (no etcd needed). Copy the Quickstart's two files
# and change resources_file to the local path, e.g. resources_file: ./resources.yaml
cargo run -p sibyl-gateway-server --bin sibyl-gateway -- --config config.local.yaml

# Check a resources file without starting a listener
cargo run -p sibyl-gateway-server --bin sibyl-gateway -- validate --resources resources.yaml
```
