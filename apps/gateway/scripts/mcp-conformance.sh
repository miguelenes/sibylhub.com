# Official MCP conformance suite against the shipped /mcp gateway chain:
# conformance client → scoped gateway → EphemeralBridge → in-process
# upstream (see crates/sibyl-gateway-mcp/examples/conformance_server.rs).
#
# Runs every scenario applicable to the tools-only surface. The scenarios
# NOT in the list are deliberate surface decisions, documented in the
# example's module docs: prompts/resources content scenarios (capabilities
# this gateway does not advertise), server-initiated relay scenarios
# (sampling/elicitation/progress/logging), the Host-allowlist half of
# dns-rebinding-protection (the endpoint is API-key-gated at the proxy
# layer), and session-dependent scenarios (this gateway is stateless by
# design). Growing this list is expected as the gateway's MCP surface
# grows.
#
# The suite AND its full transitive dependency graph are pinned by
# tools/mcp-conformance/package-lock.json (`npm ci`); a floating install
# would let protocol behavior drift with the suite's own SDK dependency.
