// E2E (regression for AISIX-Cloud#850): a guardrail attached to ONE model
// via a `scope_type: "model"` attachment must run ONLY for requests that
// target that model. A request to a DIFFERENT (unscoped) model must NOT
// trigger the guardrail.
//
// The reported bug: a guardrail scoped to models {opus-4.7, gpt-5.5} still
// fired on a request to glm5.1 (an unselected model). The DP's
// `GuardrailIndex::resolve` matches model scope by the virtual-model UUID,
// so a correctly-loaded model attachment never matches an unscoped model.
// The failure mode this guards is a model attachment that never reaches the
// DP snapshot (e.g. a pre-#630 image that dropped watch-applied
// attachments): the guardrail then has zero loaded attachments and, since
// AISIX-Cloud#1450 retired the implicit-env fallback, inspects NOTHING —
// the rule is silently absent rather than silently global.
//
// This test creates the attachment via the same etcd watch path cp-api
// uses (`/<prefix>/guardrail_attachments/<uuid>`), so it exercises the
// load + resolve pipeline end-to-end. No DP-side attachment admin endpoint
// exists, so the harness writes the row directly to etcd.
