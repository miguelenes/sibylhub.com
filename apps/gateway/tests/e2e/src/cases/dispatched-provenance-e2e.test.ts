// E2E: the `sibyl_gateway_deployment_*` families read as UPSTREAM health for one
// deployment target, so an attempt that never left the gateway must not
// appear in them. Two kinds of attempt never leave: one the target's own
// rate-limit layers refuse, and — the kind this file pins — one the bridge
// rejects while still assembling the request.
//
// Counting those as `sibyl_gateway_deployment_failure_responses_total` reports our
// own misconfiguration as provider degradation: an operator watching a
// target's failure rate sees the provider "failing" while the provider was
// never asked anything. The upstream request count is the ground truth
// here — it stays at zero across every measured call.
//
// Two rejection points, because they are raised in different places and a
// fix for one does not imply the other:
//
//   - an unusable secret, caught by the bridge's own `api_key()` guard
//     before any request is built;
//   - an `api_base` that does not parse, which reaches reqwest as a raw
//     string and fails at `send()` as a *builder* error, with no socket
//     ever opened.
//
// Every changed dispatch branch is exercised, not just one: the
// classification is applied at four separate call sites (streaming and
// non-streaming chat, `/v1/messages`, `/v1/responses`) and any of them can
// regress to `dispatched: true` on its own while the others stay correct.
//
// The mirror assertion matters just as much: the attempt is NOT dropped.
// It stays a real attempt in the per-attempt usage events (the rows the
// dashboard log counts), exactly as a rate-limit-refused attempt does. The
// deployment families are the only place it is excluded from.
