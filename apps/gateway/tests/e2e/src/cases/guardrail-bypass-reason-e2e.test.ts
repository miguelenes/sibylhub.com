// E2E: `UsageEvent.guardrail_bypassed_reason` across the handler family
// (api7/sibyl-gateway, follow-up to #1115), against a real DP + etcd + a real SOC
// export target.
//
// A fail-open bypass is the one guardrail outcome nobody sees. The caller
// gets a normal 200, the response looks screened, and the usage row is
// byte-identical to a request the chain actually decided. The field exists
// so an operator can tell those apart — and until this change it was
// written on `/v1/chat/completions` and nowhere else, so on every other
// route an outage passed traffic unscreened and left no trace.
//
// Two causes reach the field and both are driven here:
//   - the guardrail could not evaluate (a `kind: custom` script that
//     throws is the provider-outage shape without a provider), which
//     reports the kind's own bounded tag;
//   - the body could not be scanned at all, which reports the same tag the
//     fail-CLOSED direction puts in its refusal envelope.
//
// One `fail_open: true` row governs the whole family, which is the point:
// the reason has to reach every handler's terminal event, not just the one
// whose test was written first.
