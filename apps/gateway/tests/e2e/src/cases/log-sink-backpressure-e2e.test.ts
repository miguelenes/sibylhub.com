// E2E: a log consumer that stops reading must not stop the gateway.
//
// The gateway's log descriptor is a pipe, and in Kubernetes the reader is
// the container runtime's log shim. Kubelet rotating and gzipping the
// container log stops that reader for a moment — routinely, because the
// rotation is driven by the gateway's own access-log volume. The pipe is
// 64 KiB; once it is full, `write` blocks the thread that logged. On the
// stability benchmark that froze the only request worker for 0.65 s,
// `/livez` included, with the process at 0.00 CPU and the upstream
// answering normally throughout.
//
// So this spawns a real gateway against real etcd and a real upstream,
// stops draining its log pipe, and keeps serving traffic. What is pinned
// is that requests still complete — the log is allowed to lose lines,
// which is the trade the queue makes, and `sibyl_gateway_log_lines_dropped_total`
// is how that loss is visible.
//
// The batch has to write more than the pipe holds to mean anything: at
// `info` the gateway emits an access-log line and a usage line per
// request, a few hundred bytes each, so several hundred requests is
// comfortably past 64 KiB.
