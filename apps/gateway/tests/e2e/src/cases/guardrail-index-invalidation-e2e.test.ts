// E2E for what invalidates the runtime guardrail index (AISIX-Cloud#1542).
//
// The index is rebuilt lazily, on the first request that resolves a
// guardrail after the configuration changed, on the worker thread serving
// that request — and building it constructs one runtime instance per
// enabled attachment, each with its own HTTP client. So "what counts as a
// change" is a latency question, not a bookkeeping one: while the index
// keyed on the single global snapshot version, one API-key edit made every
// worker reconstruct every attachment before it could answer anything,
// liveness probes included.
//
// The three things a spec has to hold apart here:
//   - a write to a resource the index does not read must not rebuild it;
//   - a write to an attachment must, and exactly once;
//   - and after either, the guardrails in force must still be the
//     configured ones — a cache that never invalidates would also pass a
//     test that only counted rebuilds.
//
// Rebuilds are observed through the gateway's own `guardrail index
// rebuilt` log line rather than a metric, which is why the app runs at
// `info`.
