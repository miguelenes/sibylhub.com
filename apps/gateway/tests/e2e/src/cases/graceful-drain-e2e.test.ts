// E2E: what happens between SIGTERM and the process exiting.
//
// A load balancer learns that a replica is going away by polling its
// health check, so it keeps routing new connections for one check
// interval after `/readyz` starts answering 503. Closing the listener at
// signal time refuses every connection routed inside that window — which
// is how a rolling update surfaces at the caller as 502/503 even though
// nothing is actually broken.
//
// So the gateway keeps serving after the signal: `/readyz` flips
// immediately, new connections are still accepted for at least
// `shutdown.min_drain_secs`, and the listener only closes once nothing is
// left in flight. Responses carry `Connection: close` throughout, so a
// pooling client retires its connections as it uses them rather than
// holding idle ones open until the listener disappears.
