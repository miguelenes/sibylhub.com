// `managed.cp_base_url` (env SIBYL_GATEWAY_MANAGED__CP_BASE_URL, Helm
// controlPlane.baseURL) reaches four consumers with two different
// appetites: the etcd dial strips whatever scheme is present and
// re-attaches `https://` itself, while heartbeat, telemetry and the
// budget gate concatenate a path onto the value verbatim.
//
// So a scheme-less `host:port` used to dial etcd happily — the console
// showed the gateway connected — while every REST call produced
// `host:port/dp/...`, which reqwest rejects when the request is BUILT.
// That failure is indistinguishable from an unreachable control plane,
// so the budget gate's no-cache fallback sticky-denied and every proxied
// request answered `429 budget_exceeded` (AISIX-Cloud#1643).
//
// The gateway now gives the value a scheme once, at config load. These
// specs pin the two halves of that decision at the process boundary,
// where an operator meets them: a scheme-less value is accepted, and a
// value that is no http(s) URL stops the boot instead of booting into a
// gateway that refuses all traffic.

  // green on `main` too, because the gateway spawned here is NOT in
  // managed mode (no cert bundle, so `managed.enabled` stays false and
  // nothing reads the value) — the reject spec below is the one that
  // goes red without the fix. Managed mode proper has no counterpart
  // in this harness; it needs a real control plane to register against.
