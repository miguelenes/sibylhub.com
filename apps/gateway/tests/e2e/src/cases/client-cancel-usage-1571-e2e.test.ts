// written left NO row in the usage log. Every endpoint emits from the tail of
// its own handler, and axum drops that future when the client disconnects —
// so a request that reached a provider and kept it busy was invisible to the
// control plane, which is the case an operator most needs to see (the usual
// reason a caller gives up is a long time to first token).

// The scenario is deliberately a ROUTING group: the group is what the caller
// addressed and the target is what the gateway was waiting on, and a single
// `direct` model — which every earlier cancel test used — makes those two
// identities the same value, so it cannot tell a correct row from one that
