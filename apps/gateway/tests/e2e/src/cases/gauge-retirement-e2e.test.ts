// E2E for the gauge-retirement sweep.
//
// Three gauge families are written only from the request (or health-check)
// path, and the recorder registers no idle timeout — so a series whose key
// is deleted is never written again and keeps reporting its last value as
// though it described the present. The documented budget alert has no
// defence against that: the stranded sample carries `details_present=1`
// too, so a key that was over its threshold when it was deleted latches
// the alert until the process restarts.
//
// `sibyl_gateway_ratelimit_remaining_*` is the family that can be driven with no
// control plane — the value comes from the data plane's own limiter — so
// it is what proves the whole chain here against a real binary: the series
// is registered on a request, the key is deleted from etcd, and the sweep
// running on the periodic upkeep task retires it.
//
// The retired value is asserted as the literal `NaN`, not "absent" and not
// zero. Zero is a MEANINGFUL value on this metric — `remaining_requests 0`
// says the caller is out of quota — so a retirement that zeroed would
// replace a stale claim with a false one. Checking the rendered text
// rather than the parsed samples is deliberate: the harness's sample
// regex does not match `NaN`, so a parsed-only assertion would pass
// equally for "retired", "never emitted" and "series dropped".
