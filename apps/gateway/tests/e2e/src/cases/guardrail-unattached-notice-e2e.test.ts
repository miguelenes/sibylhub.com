// E2E for the notice a gateway logs about an enabled guardrail that
// nothing attaches.
//
// The gateway sweeps for these on a timer rather than reporting from an
// index build, and this file exists because both halves of that are easy
// to get wrong in ways nothing else catches.
//
// It must stay QUIET on a guardrail that is correctly attached. The
// guardrail and its attachment are separate documents arriving as separate
// writes, so there is always a window where the gateway holds one and not
// the other; naming a row there is a log line saying a security control
// inspects no traffic, about one that does — and, deduplicated per id for
// the life of the process, it never ages out.
//
// It must SPEAK on a guardrail that really is attached to nothing, and the
// case that matters is not the one that is easy to test: a scope target
// deleted out from under a rule that was screening traffic yesterday.
// Nobody writes anything afterwards, so a notice that rides a config change
// is never delivered.
//
// The timings below are the gateway's own (`UNATTACHED_GRACE`,
// `UNATTACHED_SWEEP_INTERVAL`). They are wall time, which is why this file
// is slow; the arithmetic of the grace itself is unit-tested with an
// injected clock.
