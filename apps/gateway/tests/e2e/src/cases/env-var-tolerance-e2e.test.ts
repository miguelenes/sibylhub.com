// E2E: an `SIBYL_GATEWAY_*` environment variable the gateway does not recognise
// must not stop it from starting.
//
// The gateway reads `SIBYL_GATEWAY_<SECTION>__<KEY>` as configuration overrides
// and its root config struct rejects unknown fields, so anything else
// prefixed `SIBYL_GATEWAY_` used to abort the boot with `unknown field`. Two
// environments produce such names without anyone asking for them:
//
//   - Kubernetes service links. Every pod in a namespace gets six or seven
//     variables per Service, named after the Service — so one Service
//     called `sibyl-gateway-oss` is enough to make every gateway pod in that
//     namespace crash-loop before it opens a listener.
//   - The gateway's own `SIBYL_GATEWAY_CONFIG`, the documented env fallback for
//     `--config`. Setting it was fatal, which meant the fallback could
//     never be used.
//
// Both are driven here against the real binary because the failure was a
// process that exited, which no in-process test can observe.

// A Service named `sibyl-gateway-oss` exposing 9090, as kubelet spells it.
