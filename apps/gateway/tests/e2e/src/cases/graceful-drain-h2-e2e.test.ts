// E2E: the retirement signal an HTTP/2 downstream gets during a drain.
//
// `graceful-drain-e2e` covers the HTTP/1.1 half, where retirement is a
// response header: a client that pools connections sees `Connection:
// close` on whatever it is served during the window and retires the
// connection as it uses it. HTTP/2 forbids that header (RFC 9113 §8.2.2)
// and has no header in its place — its retirement signal is GOAWAY, a
// connection-level frame.
//
// So the gateway sends one when the drain STARTS, and that is the whole
// of what this spec pins:
//
//   - the frame arrives at SIGTERM, not when the listener finally closes
//     — otherwise an h2 downstream keeps dispatching onto the connection
//     for the entire grace period and the drain never converges;
//   - GOAWAY does not cut off the streams already running on it;
//   - and it does not take the listener with it, because a balancer is
//     still routing new connections here until its next health check.
//
// Node's `http2.connect()` over `http://` speaks h2c with prior
// knowledge, which is how a fronting proxy configured for HTTP/2
// upstreams reaches the gateway — no TLS, no ALPN.
