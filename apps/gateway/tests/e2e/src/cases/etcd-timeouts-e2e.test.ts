// range read that never answered stayed in flight forever, and the
// instance served nothing while producing no error that explained why.
//
// These specs pin the contract an operator sees — the bound aborts such
// a read and hands the supervisor a retryable failure; unset AND `0`
// both leave the read unbounded, with no implicit default, which is what
// keeps a large configuration set bootable; the watch stream is exempt,
// so a set bound does not tear down a quiet watch.
//
// Most of them drive the gateway through a TCP relay standing in for
// etcd, which is what makes a call that never completes reproducible:
// `hold()` accepts the connection and forwards nothing.
