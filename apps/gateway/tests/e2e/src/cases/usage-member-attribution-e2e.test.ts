// E2E for AISIX-Cloud#1389: the usage event must name the org MEMBER behind
// the request, not just the credential it arrived on.
//
// The ask is "show me Alice's 429s in the last 24h". Before this, the only
// caller identity on a usage row was `api_key_id` (plus a JWT subject), so
// answering it meant enumerating every key Alice owns, querying each, and
// merging by hand — and a member calling through both an API key and OIDC
// would still be split across two identities. `user_id` is snapshotted onto
// the event at request time rather than resolved from `api_key_id` at query
// time, so rebinding or deleting a key cannot re-attribute or erase the
// history it already produced.
//
// Read back off a real Aliyun-SLS export from a real `sibyl-gateway` binary, so what
// is asserted is the row a consumer actually receives.
//
// The three probes are the claim's real content:
//   - the API-key path stamps the owning member;
//   - a JWT resolving to a DIFFERENT key owned by the SAME member stamps the
//     same member — this is the "one member, several credentials" half of
//     the report, and it is the one a join on api_key_id gets wrong;
//   - an unowned key stamps nobody, so a member filter cannot sweep up
//     traffic that was never theirs.
//
// The last case pins the OTHER half of the report's driving question. A 429
// reaches a caller two ways — the upstream throttled us, or the gateway's
// own rate limit refused the request before any upstream was contacted —
// and only the first is an upstream *attempt*. The gateway's own refusal
// leaves the failure path with zero attempts, which is a genuinely
// different code path (`chat.rs`'s `match charge` zero-attempt arm rather
// than its per-attempt loop). Both must reach the usage feed carrying the
// member, or "show me Alice's 429s" silently answers half the question.
