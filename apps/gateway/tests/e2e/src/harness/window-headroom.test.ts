// The rate limiter buckets on fixed wall-clock windows — `roll_if_stale`
// in `crates/sibyl-gateway-ratelimit/src/window.rs` computes
// `bucket_start = (now / window_secs) * window_secs`. A burst that
// straddles a boundary lands in two buckets, the later call gets a fresh
// allowance, and any "the next call must be 429" assertion flaps
// depending on when in the minute CI happened to run it.
//
// These pin the two branches with fake timers, because the real behaviour
// is only observable in the last few seconds of a wall-clock minute and
// would otherwise go untested on almost every run.
