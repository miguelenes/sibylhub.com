 * returns false just as fast as a 50ms one. Only a retry spans a cold

 * merge-blocking e2e leg before a single test runs. ping() escalates the

/**
 * Fail the run when a configured etcd cluster is not answering.
 *
 * Nearly every case file opens with `if (!(await etcd.ping())) return;`
 * or `ctx.skip()`, which is right for a developer without etcd running
 * — but it means an unreachable cluster produces a GREEN run with those
 * files contributing nothing. With one shared cluster that was at least
 * all-or-nothing and impossible to miss. Splitting the suite across four
 * clusters (see etcdEndpoint) turns it into a partial, silent loss: one
 * dead endpoint takes out only the quarter of the files whose fork was
 * assigned to it, and `e2e (vitest) + coverage` still reports success.
 *
 * So the reachability check moves here, once, before any fork starts:
 *
 *   - on CI, every configured endpoint must answer. A skipped file on CI
 *     is a coverage hole, not a convenience.
 *   - locally, the same applies as soon as MORE THAN ONE endpoint is
 *     configured, because that is the partial-loss shape. A developer
 *     with no etcd at all, or one, keeps the quiet skip.
