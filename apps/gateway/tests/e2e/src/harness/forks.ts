 * How many vitest forks this run may use.
 *
 * One per etcd cluster, because that is the constraint that forced
 * maxForks=2 in the first place (#157: every fork's gateway watching one
 * shared cluster blew past waitConfigPropagation). Bounded three ways:
 *
 *   - floor 2, the value the suite ran at before the split, and what a
 *     developer with a single local etcd gets;
 *   - RANGE_SLOTS, because ports.ts hands fork `poolId % RANGE_SLOTS`
 *     its own port range and beyond that two forks share one;
 *   - the core count, because each fork drives a real `sibyl-gateway` process
 *     and several cases assert wall-clock bounds derived on a loaded
 *     runner (audio-timeout, ttft-first-frame, per-attempt-telemetry).
 *
 * The core cap is why adding a fifth etcd service to a 4-core runner
 * would buy nothing: the endpoint list is a ceiling on concurrency, not
 * a target.
 *
 * SIBYL_GATEWAY_E2E_MAX_FORKS can only LOWER the result. Letting it raise past
 * the endpoint count would put two gateways' watch sets on one cluster
 * — #157 exactly — while vitest.config.ts advertises the opposite as a
 * guarantee, so the knob is clamped by the same bound everything else
 * is.
