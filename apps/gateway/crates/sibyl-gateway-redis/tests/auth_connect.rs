//! What a boot does with a credential the Redis server has an opinion
//! about, against a live `redis:7 --requirepass`.
//!
//! Runs only when `REDIS_AUTH_TEST_URL` + `REDIS_AUTH_TEST_PASSWORD` are
//! set (CI starts a password-protected Redis for it; absence is a no-op
//! so local unit runs stay hermetic).
//!
//! Two properties, and they are the same property seen from both sides:
//! a server that ANSWERS and refuses must be told apart from one that
//! never answered, and a credential supplied through the `password`
//! field must reach the handshake — because the failure that made both
//! of these tests necessary was the gateway reporting `connected` in one
//! case and `redis connect timed out` in the other, never once naming
//! the password.
//!
//! Neither outcome ends a boot. What the classification decides is what
//! the operator is TOLD while the gateway serves degraded, and whether
//! the background re-attach is waiting on a network or on them.
