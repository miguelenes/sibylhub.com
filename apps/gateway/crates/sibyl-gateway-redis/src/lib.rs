//! Shared Redis connection layer for the response cache
//! ([`sibyl-gateway-cache`]) and the shared rate-limit counter store
//! ([`sibyl-gateway-ratelimit`]).
//!
//! Both subsystems used to hold a single-node [`ConnectionManager`]
//! directly. This crate factors the connection out behind one
//! [`RedisConn`] so the operator can pick the topology with
//! `redis.mode` — `single`, `cluster`, or `sentinel` — and both
//! subsystems support all three without each re-implementing the
//! dispatch (and drifting apart).
//!
//! A live connection is obtained per operation via
//! [`RedisConn::acquire`], which yields a [`RedisConnHandle`] that
//! implements [`redis::aio::ConnectionLike`], so existing call sites
//! keep running `Script::invoke_async`/`cmd().query_async` against it
//! unchanged.
//!
//! - **single** — a [`ConnectionManager`] (transparent reconnect). The
//!   handle is a cheap clone; `acquire` never fails.
//! - **cluster** — a [`cluster_async::ClusterConnection`] that discovers
//!   the slot topology and reconnects internally. The handle is a cheap
//!   clone; `acquire` never fails. NOTE: scripts that touch multiple keys
//!   must declare a key carrying the bucket hash tag so the `EVAL` routes
//!   to the slot owning every key it touches — callers are responsible
//!   for that (see `sibyl-gateway-ratelimit`).
//! - **sentinel** — a [`SentinelClient`] that resolves the current master
//!   for `master_name`. `redis` 0.27 has no auto-reconnecting sentinel
//!   connection, so on a master failover the cached connection breaks;
//!   [`RedisConn::note_error`] drops it and the next `acquire` re-resolves
//!   the new master through the sentinels.
//!
//! # Bounded failure
//!
//! Every consumer of this layer fails **open** on a Redis error — the
//! rate limiter degrades to per-replica counters, the caches to a miss —
//! but that only helps if the error *arrives*. A peer that stops
//! answering without closing the socket (host down, network partition, a
//! stopped container) leaves a command blocked on TCP retransmission for
//! minutes, so the fallback is never reached and the request hangs.
//!
//! Two mechanisms, both applied here so no consumer can forget them:
//!
//! - **A timeout on every command and every connection attempt**, from
//!   `redis.timeout_secs` (default 5s). It is set natively on the driver
//!   for all three topologies *and* enforced around each command, because
//!   the native response timeout does not cover time spent waiting on the
//!   connection manager's own in-progress reconnect — which is where the
//!   remaining unbounded wait lived.
//! - **A cool-off breaker, shared per subsystem.** Paying the timeout on *every* request during
//!   an outage is still a several-second latency floor for as long as the
//!   outage lasts. After a connectivity failure the subsystem is held
//!   open for [`BREAKER_WINDOW`] — 30s, long enough to span an upstream
//!   call so a request's cache write is still covered by the cool-off its
//!   cache read opened; commands issued inside that window
//!   return an error immediately, with no round trip, so each consumer's
//!   existing fail-open branch runs at once.
//! - **A background prober closes it.** Opening the breaker starts a task
//!   that PINGs Redis when the window expires, closes the breaker on
//!   success and re-arms the window on failure. Business commands keep
//!   short-circuiting until it closes, so none of them is ever the
//!   half-open probe: a probe that lands on a still-unreachable Redis
//!   pays the full command budget, and during a minutes-long outage that
//!   is one request per window paying it for nothing. The recovery
//!   latency is unchanged — the breaker still closes within one window of
//!   Redis coming back — it is simply no longer billed to a caller.
//!   What a PING proves is narrower than what the old probe proved,
//!   because the old probe was a real command: a server that answers
//!   PING while the operations this subsystem actually runs keep timing
//!   out (a loaded vector search, a partly-down cluster) closes the
//!   breaker, and the commands behind it each pay one budget until the
//!   first failure re-opens it. That is one window's worth of concurrent
//!   commands rather than one command — bounded, and the alternative is
//!   billing a caller for detection on every window of every outage.
//!
//! The same reasoning applies to the connection a subsystem opens at
//! **boot**, which nothing else bounds: [`connect_bounded`] spends at
//! most one budget there, because the driver's own retry schedule for
//! the initial connect is measured in minutes and boot holds the
//! listeners closed while it runs.
//!
//! The breaker belongs to a **subsystem**, not to a connection — see
//! [`FailurePolicy`]. A subsystem may hold several connections (the cache
//! holds two: exact-KV and vector search) and one request touches all of
//! them, so a per-connection breaker let a single request pay the budget
//! once per connection.
//!
//! Breaker short-circuits are ordinary `Err`s, so they are counted by the
//! consumers' existing `sibyl_gateway_redis_failures_total{operation=...}` calls
//! with no new metric.
