//! sibyl-gateway-provider-anthropic — Anthropic Messages API [`AnthropicBridge`].
//!
//! Translates the gateway's OpenAI-shaped [`ChatFormat`] into Claude's
//! `/v1/messages` contract and back. Streaming support maps Anthropic's
//! typed SSE events (`message_start`, `content_block_delta`,
//! `message_delta`, `message_stop`) to the gateway's flat `ChatChunk`
//! stream.
//!
//! See the `Bridge` trait in `sibyl-gateway-hub` for the contract this crate
//! implements against.

/// Inbound Anthropic-protocol translation surface — used by the

///
/// - [`parse_inbound_request`] turns the request body into
///   `ChatFormat` so any Bridge can dispatch it, and
///   [`parse_inbound_request_for_scan`] does the same for the guardrail
///   chain — the two differ only in whether an assistant turn's
///   `thinking` blocks survive.
/// - [`chat_response_into_anthropic_json`] renders the bridge's
///   `ChatResponse` back as Anthropic JSON.
/// - [`AnthropicSseEncoder`] re-encodes the bridge's `ChatChunk`
///   stream as Anthropic typed SSE events.
/// - [`strip_billing_header_attribution`] drops the client's
///   Anthropic-only billing attribution line from `system` before the
///   body is sent to any other provider.
