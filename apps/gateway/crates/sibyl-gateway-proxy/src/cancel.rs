//! The usage telemetry of a request whose caller hung up before the
//! response head was written (AISIX-Cloud#1571).
//!
//! Every endpoint emits its usage events from the tail of its own handler.
//! When the downstream client disconnects first, axum drops the handler
//! future and none of that code runs — the emission is continuation code,
//! and a dropped future has no continuation. The request then reached an
//! upstream, possibly spent a provider's tokens, and left no row in the
//! usage log at all, which is exactly the case an operator most needs to
//! see: the usual reason a caller gives up is a long time to first token.
//!
//! So the emission moves to the one thing cancellation cannot skip: `Drop`.
//! `ClientCancelGuard` hands what the request managed to resolve — see
//! [`crate::attribution`] — to [`emit`], which writes the same events the
//! handler would have:
//!
//! - one non-terminal event per attempt that had already FAILED, byte-for-
//!   byte what `emit_failed_attempts` would have written for it;
//! - one terminal event for the request itself, `499` /
//!   `client_disconnected`, zero tokens and zero cost, naming the target
//!   that was in flight when the caller went away.
//!
//! Exactly one emitter ever speaks for a given request. The guard rides the
//! request from the middleware to the end of its response body and writes
//! the terminal event only where nothing else can (`crate::GuardPhase`): no
//! response head at all, or a head whose body was dropped before its first
//! poll — the window in which a streaming family's own `Drop` emitter does
//! not yet exist. Once the body has been polled, or once the handler has
//! emitted its own terminal event, the guard stays silent.
//!
//! Two things this path deliberately does NOT carry. A cancelled request's
//! events have no guardrail attribution (`applied_guardrails`,
//! `guardrail_enforced_hits`, `guardrail_scores`, the bypass reason): those
//! come off a chain each handler resolves for itself, with no chokepoint a
//! guard could read, and ten opt-in call sites is the drift this design
//! exists to avoid. And an attempt that had already SUCCEEDED is not
//! re-emitted: its token counts live in the handler's response processing,
//! not in the attempt record, so there is nothing to bill it with.
