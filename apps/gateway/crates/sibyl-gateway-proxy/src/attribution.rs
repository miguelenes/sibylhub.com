//! What the request has committed to upstream, for the terminal emitters
//! that cannot see it.
//!
//! Two of them run without the values the rest of the request already
//! resolved:
//!
//! - the client-cancel guard in `record_request_telemetry` is armed in
//!   middleware — before auth, body parsing and model resolution — and
//!   fires from `Drop` once the handler future has been dropped, so it
//!   could only ever label `endpoint` (AISIX-Cloud#1317);
//! - every handler's failure branch holds a `ProxyError`, which carries
//!   no upstream identity. A request that reached a real provider and
//!   came back 502 therefore reported `provider="unknown"` on the same
//!   series its successes report the real provider, which puts successes
//!   and failures of one ProviderKey in different time series and makes
//!   a per-provider failure rate meaningless (AISIX-Cloud#1325).
//!
//! Both read the cell the telemetry middleware installs for the request.
//! Writes ride the two resolution chokepoints every endpoint already goes
//! through — [`crate::model_resolve::resolve_model`] for the model the
//! caller addressed and [`crate::dispatch::resolve_provider_key`] for the
//! target about to be dispatched to — so a new endpoint is attributed
//! without opting in, and a retry / fallback loop leaves the LAST target
//! it selected behind, which is the attempt the client's error came from.
//!
//! It is a task-local rather than a threaded parameter because the cancel
//! guard reads it from outside the handler entirely. A write with no
//! scope installed (background health checks, unit tests) is dropped.
//!
//! [`CancelContext`] is the same idea carried one step further. The cancel
//! guard does not only LABEL a cancelled request any more — it emits the
//! request's usage events, because the handler code that would have done so
//! is continuation code that a dropped future never runs (AISIX-Cloud#1571).
//! That needs more than labels: the caller's identity, the attempt that was
//! in flight, and the attempts that already failed. All of it is written at
//! chokepoints the handlers already pass through — the [`ClientContext`]
//! extractor, [`crate::model_resolve::resolve_model`], and
//! [`crate::attempt::RoutingTelemetry`] — so no endpoint has to opt in and
//! none of them can drift out.
//!
//! The cell carries one more thing for the same reason: a streamed
//! response's access-log LINE ([`PendingAccessLog`]). Its handler returns
//! when the head goes out, minutes before the request ends, so the line is
//! parked here and written by whichever terminal emitter ends the request.
//!
//! It is kept BESIDE [`Resolved`] rather than inside it because every
//! failed request reads `Resolved` back by value for its metric labels
//! ([`current`]); folding a `Vec<AttemptRecord>` and a `ClientContext` into
//! that clone would put the cancel path's cost on every error path.
