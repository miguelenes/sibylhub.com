//! Axum state shared across every proxy handler.
//!
//! `ProxyState` holds:
//! - the lock-free `SnapshotHandle<GatewaySnapshot>` for looking up
//!   Models and ApiKeys on every request
//! - the `Hub` for resolving a `Provider` to the Bridge that serves it
//! - the per-key [`Limiter`] — queried before each upstream call and
//!   finalised after the response completes
//! - an `Arc<Metrics>` shared with the admin `/metrics` endpoint
//! - the [`CacheBackends`] consulted before bridge dispatch (None disables
//!   caching for that ProxyState; tests use this to keep the cache off
//!   the hot path when they don't care about it)
//! - the configured request-body size limit
//!
//! Cheap to clone: every field is either an `Arc` or a small Copy scalar.
