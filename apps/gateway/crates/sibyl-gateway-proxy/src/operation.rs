//! The bounded name of the work a request asked for, and the handler family
//! that served it.
//!
//! A usage event already says which protocol addressed the gateway
//! (`inbound_protocol`) and which model answered — but not what was asked
//! for. Every OpenAI-shaped route collapses onto `inbound_protocol="openai"`,
//! so a text chat, an image generation and a video submission are one
//! undifferentiated stream to an exporter consumer. The only way to tell them
//! apart was to regex a captured prompt, which `content_mode = metadata_only`
//! deployments do not have and which a video submission (zero tokens, no
//! captured content) does not answer at all (AISIX-Cloud#1461).
//!
//! [`Surface`] pairs the two labels a terminal emitter needs and hands them
//! out as constants, because they must not be able to disagree: `handler` is
//! the Prometheus label a family has always reported, and `operation` is the
//! finer name that goes on the usage event. Most families map one to one.
//! Three do not, and those are exactly the families where the coarse label
//! answers "what kind of call was this" wrongly:
//!
//! - `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits` share `handler="images"`;
//! - the three `/v1/audio/*` routes share `handler="audio"`, and one of them
//!   consumes audio while another produces it;
//! - `handler="videos"` covers a submission that generates a video and two
//!   routes that only poll and download it, so the label alone cannot say
//!   how much video was actually generated.
//!
//! Both values are `&'static str` chosen by the route, never by caller text,
//! so neither can mint an unbounded label (#451).
