//! End-of-stream output-guardrail observation for the live-forward
//! streaming paths (AISIX-Cloud#1010).
//!
//! A live-forwarded stream has already put its bytes on the wire, so an
//! output-hook chain can no longer block it — which is exactly why only
//! the chains that *can't* block reach here: a block-capable chain
//! resolves to a hold-back [`sibyl_gateway_guardrails::StreamOutputPolicy`] and
//! takes its endpoint's buffered branch instead. What remains is the
//! monitor-only chain, whose whole purpose is to observe without changing
//! delivery — so it must still get its scan, and must never hold the
//! stream back to get it.
//!
//! Shared by `/v1/responses` (#808) and the streamed audio transcription
//! relay (#998); both assemble the response text as it streams and hand
//! it here once the upstream ends.
