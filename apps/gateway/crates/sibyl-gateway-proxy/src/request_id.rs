///
/// One shared mechanism instead of a per-handler header insert: the

/// completions / embeddings / responses / messages all shipped without
/// it in v0.3.0), which is exactly the kind of gap the
/// fix-the-whole-class rule exists to prevent. Minting here and reading
/// it back through `ClientContext` keeps the header equal to the
/// telemetry `request_id`, so the header is actually usable for
/// correlation rather than a second, unrelated id.
///
/// It also opens the request-scoped tracing span, so every log line a
/// request emits carries its `request_id` without each call site having
/// to thread one down (AISIX-Cloud#1060). That is what makes a deep
/// diagnostic — e.g. the Aliyun guardrail's `aliyun_request_id` — join
/// back to the `x-sibylhub-request-id` the caller was handed. The span is
/// attached to the future rather than entered with a guard: a guard held
/// across an await would leak the span onto whatever else the executor
/// runs on this thread.
///
/// Two connection-level identities ride the same span, for the same
/// reason and with the same reach — the access log, the per-attempt
/// `provider call completed` line, and every diagnostic in between:
///
/// - `peer`, the accepted socket's remote address INCLUDING its port. It
///   is deliberately not the resolved client IP that
///   [`ClientContext::source_ip`](crate::client_ip::ClientContext) already
///   carries: that one answers "who is the caller", follows
///   `proxy.real_ip`, and has no port. This one answers "which TCP
///   connection", and the port is the whole of its value — behind a
///   layer-4 load balancer with the gateway on the host network it is the
///   only field that joins a gateway log line to the fronting proxy's
///   record of the same connection.
/// - `downstream_request_id`, from [`DOWNSTREAM_REQUEST_ID_HEADER`], so a
///   trace id minted before the gateway can be searched for here.
///
/// Both are recorded rather than declared, so a request that carried
/// neither logs neither field instead of an empty one.

/// `http_version` is the third, and it is always known, so it is
