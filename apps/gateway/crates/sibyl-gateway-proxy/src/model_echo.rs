//! Restamp the client-facing `model` field onto a native passthrough response.
//!
//! The wire contract is stated once, in [`crate::render`]: `response.model`
//! carries the model name the CALLER addressed — the alias they put on the
//! request — never the upstream provider's own id. That is what makes an
//! alias an alias: the caller names one thing, and every answer they get back
//! names the same thing, whichever provider or routing target actually served
//! it.
//!
//! The bridged dispatch paths satisfy that by construction: they build the
//! client-facing body themselves and stamp the caller's name into it. The
//! NATIVE passthrough paths do not — they forward the upstream's own document,
//! which carries the upstream's own id. This module is where that difference
//! is repaired, so the paths that use it cannot drift apart again.
//!
//! `/v1/fine_tuning/jobs` is deliberately outside the family: its request
//! half forwards the caller's `model` to the provider verbatim, so naming the
//! upstream base model on both halves is the symmetric answer there (#1089).
//!
//! Three shapes, because a native path answers in three:
//!
//! - [`restamp_body`] for a parsed JSON response.
//! - [`restamp_json_bytes`] for a response the path relays as raw bytes
//!   rather than re-serialising (`/v1/rerank`), and for one WebSocket text
//!   frame (`/v1/realtime`).
//! - [`restamp_sse_frame`] for one frame of a streamed response.
//!
//! The last two splice the value through [`crate::json_splice`] rather than
//! re-serialising the document, so every byte the gateway is not deliberately
//! changing — key order, whitespace, number spellings, escape choices —
//! reaches the client exactly as the provider wrote it.
//!
//! All three are deliberately no-ops when the document carries no `model` at
//! the selected path. A response that never had the field does not acquire
//! one.
