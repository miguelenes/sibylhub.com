//! Explicit passthrough routes (`PassthroughRoute` resources).
//!
//! Replaces the removed implicit `/passthrough/:provider/*rest` tunnel: a
//! route binds a gateway entry (path prefix and/or inbound `Host`) to ONE
//! upstream target with its own gateway-auth mode and credential handling.
//! There is no implicit provider→Model credential borrowing
//! (AISIX-Cloud#1127) and no forced `Authorization` replacement
//! (AISIX-Cloud#1312).
//!
//! ## Envelope detection
//!
//! The request body's envelope is detected once per exchange from its
//! top-level keys ([`detect_protocol`]) and drives guardrail text
//! extraction, content capture and usage extraction for both the request
//! and the response (buffered or streamed). Detection never affects the
//! relay itself — bodies are forwarded verbatim regardless — and every
//! extraction degrades to the whole lossy-UTF-8 body when the detected
//! shape yields no text, so a mis-detected envelope loses no audit
//! coverage. SSE upstream responses are always relayed incrementally;
//! anything else is buffered (guardrails and usage need the whole body).
//!
//! A DETECTED envelope must observe what the typed endpoint serving that
//! same envelope observes — every token dimension of
//! [`sibyl_gateway_obs::UsageEvent`], the caller's model alias, the guardrail text
//! including tool calls, TTFT, and a 499 for a stream the client
//! abandoned. Anything less makes a route a place where enforcement and
//! metering quietly weaken.
//!
//! ## Entry points
//!
//! - [`entry`] — the proxy router's **fallback** handler. Path-prefix
//!   routes match here, after every typed route has had its chance, so a
//!   route can never shadow `/v1/*`, `/mcp`, or `/a2a`. A no-match request
//!   keeps the pre-existing plain 404, `/passthrough/*` included — that
//!   namespace is claimed by explicit routes like any other.
//! - [`host_dispatch`] — a **pre-routing** middleware (after URL rewriting in
//!   `build_router`). A request whose `Host` matches an enabled route's
//!   `hosts` was never addressed to this gateway's own API, so it must not
//!   fall into a typed route that happens to share the path (forward-proxy
//!   traffic: a TLS-terminating device delivers e.g.
//!   `Host: api.githubcopilot.com` with its original path). On a host
//!   match the middleware dispatches straight to [`entry`].
//!
//! ## Auth
//!
//! Per-route `auth_mode`: `gateway_key` reads the standard
//! `Authorization: Bearer` / `x-api-key` gateway credential; `header_key`
//! reads it from the route's `auth_header_name` (leaving `Authorization`
//! for the upstream credential); `anonymous` binds the request to the
//! route's `anonymous_key_id` principal, gated by `source_cidrs`. Every
//! mode ends in an [`AuthenticatedKey`] whose `allowed_routes` ACL, rate
//! limits, and budget apply unchanged.
//!
//! ## Credentials
//!
//! `inject` strips inbound credential headers (the ProviderKey's
//! `strip_headers`) and injects the configured ProviderKey's secret with
//! the per-provider auth shape (#166). `forward_client` forwards the
//! caller's own credential headers verbatim and strips only the gateway's
//! side-channel headers, so the gateway credential never leaks upstream.
