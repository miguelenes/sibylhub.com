//! The one chokepoint for the per-request outcome metrics every handler
//! emits once dispatch has produced a response.
//!
//! # What `elapsed` measures, and why it is not end-to-end
//!
//! Handlers call [`record`] on their way out, so for a **streamed** response
//! the `elapsed` they pass is time to response START, not the full
//! generation — the SSE body has not been polled yet. Every duration series
//! fed from here therefore mixes two scopes: full request time for
//! non-streamed traffic, time-to-response-start for streamed. `chat.rs`
//! guards the SLO histogram against exactly this
//! (`record_request_e2e_latency` is called with the stream's own duration at
//! completion instead); nothing guards the three families below.
//!
//! Read a streaming p99 off `sibyl_gateway_request_e2e_latency_seconds`, which is
//! recorded at stream completion. Do not read one off
//! `sibyl_gateway_llm_request_duration_seconds` and expect end-to-end.
//!
//! Three families ride on a single call:
//!
//! - `sibyl_gateway_requests_total` / `sibyl_gateway_request_duration_seconds` — the legacy
//!   compatibility series, four labels, every endpoint.
//! - `sibyl_gateway_proxy_requests_total` / `sibyl_gateway_proxy_failed_requests_total` /
//!   `sibyl_gateway_proxy_request_duration_seconds` — the detailed series over ALL
//!   proxied traffic.
//! - `sibyl_gateway_llm_requests_total` / `sibyl_gateway_llm_request_duration_seconds` — the
//!   subset of the above that is a model-inference call, per
//!   [`LLM_ENDPOINTS`].
//!
//! Splitting the two tiers is the point: an MCP tool call, a batch-file
//! upload and a 413 are all proxy requests, but counting them as LLM
//! requests would corrupt every per-request token/cost average and the LLM
//! success rate. What is NOT a judgement call is that both tiers must cover
//! every endpoint — before AISIX-Cloud#1234 only chat + messages emitted the
//! detailed families at all, so ten endpoints were absent from the
//! success-rate and request-count queries built on them while still showing
//! up in the legacy series.
//!
//! [`record_usage`] is the companion emit for what the request consumed —
//! the token and spend families, which had the same coverage problem, in
//! three different shapes (see its own docs).
//!
//! Handlers call [`record`] and [`record_usage`] instead of touching
//! `Metrics` directly, and the tier is decided from the endpoint rather than
//! by the caller, so a new endpoint cannot land with a half-wired label set —
//! the same anti-drift move `usage_attr` makes for the UsageEvent side.
//!
//! Two endpoints are model inference but report no tokens by nature —
//! `/v1/audio/speech` (billed per input character) and `/v1/videos` (per
//! video). They count as requests and contribute nothing to the token
//! families, so aggregate tokens-per-request is only meaningful per
//! `endpoint`, never summed across all of them.
