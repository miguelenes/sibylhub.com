//! Per-virtual-model routing state + target selection.
//!
//! When a request lands on a Model with `routing` configured, the proxy
//! asks the [`RoutingRegistry`] for an iterator of underlying target
//! Model names in attempt-order. The registry owns the per-virtual-
//! model state (smooth-WRR counters, consistent-hash rings); selection
//! itself is pure given that state.
//!
//! Targets partition into **priority tiers** first (`priority`, higher
//! value preferred, APISIX-style — each tier gets its own balancing
//! state, mirroring APISIX's per-priority pickers): the strategy orders
//! targets within each tier, tiers concatenate best-first, and a lower
//! tier is only reached after every higher-tier target failed or was
//! filtered as unavailable.
//!
//! Positional strategies pick a starting target per tier, then walk
//! forward on failure:
//! - **failover**: always start at the tier's first target, walk forward.
//! - **round_robin**: smooth weighted round-robin over target `weight`s
//!   (equal weights degrade to a plain cycle).
//! - **consistent_hash**: ketama-style hashing of the request's hash key
//!   (the `hash_on` chain) over the tier's ring; the walk follows the
//!   ring, so a failed target's keys spread to their ring successors and
//!   every other key keeps its mapping.
//!
//! Metric-ordered strategies rank targets by a runtime signal within each
//! tier (attempted best-first, then falling forward). They can't be ordered
//! from `pick_targets` because the ranking key lives on the resolved target
//! Models / runtime state, so `resolve_attempt_models` ranks them instead:
//! - **least_cost**: cheapest target first, by combined input+output per-1K
//!   price; targets without a `cost` rank last.
//! - **least_latency**: fastest target first, by an EWMA of observed upstream
//!   latency; targets with no samples yet rank first (probe, then exploit).
//! - **least_busy**: least-loaded target first, by in-flight requests
//!   divided by target `weight` (the APISIX least_conn score).
