//! A census of the input guardrail chain over every surface
//! [`crate::build_router`] mounts.
//!
//! This exists because the same defect kept landing on one sibling at a
//! time. `/v1/messages/count_tokens` shipped with no chain at all; `/mcp`
//! consulted the chain only when a `tools/call` happened to carry text;
//! `/v1/audio/*` and `/v1/images/edits` only when a `prompt` part happened
//! to be present; `/a2a` never. Each was invisible because the test that
//! was supposed to cover the family restated a hand-written list of
//! endpoints, and a list nobody updates agrees with itself forever.
//!
//! So nothing here is hand-listed. [`mounted_surfaces`] reads the routing
//! table out of `lib.rs` itself, and [`POSTURE`] must classify exactly
//! that set — mount a route without saying what it owes an operator's
//! guardrail chain and `posture_covers_every_mounted_surface` fails. A
//! surface classified [`Posture::Enforced`] must also carry a request
//! fixture, and `enforced_surfaces_refuse_a_blocking_guardrail` drives
//! each one through the real router against a guardrail that blocks
//! unconditionally. Nothing short of an actual refusal passes.
//!
//! The blocking guardrail is a `kind: custom` script, deliberately: it is
//! the one kind whose verdict does not depend on the text, so it is the
//! only one that can tell "the chain ran and decided" apart from "the
//! chain found nothing to match". That distinction is the whole bug class.
