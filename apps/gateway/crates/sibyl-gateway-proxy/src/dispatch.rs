//! Helpers shared by every endpoint that needs to dispatch to a Bridge.
//!
//! Every endpoint follows the same shape after Model resolution:
//!
//! 1. Take the resolved `Model` (already looked up by display_name).
//! 2. Resolve the `ProviderKey` it references (via `provider_key_id`).
//! 3. Compute the upstream base URL by combining the `Provider`'s
//!    default with the `ProviderKey`'s optional `api_base` override.
//!
//! These helpers existed inline in each endpoint as
//! `Model::base_url()`, `Model::upstream_model()`, and
//! `Model::provider_config.api_key` accessors. Phase B moved the
//! Model from "self-contained inline secret" to "ProviderKey
//! reference"; this module is the join point that recovers the old
//! ergonomics on the proxy side.
//!
//! Returns typed [`ProxyError`] variants so the caller's `?`
//! plumbing flows naturally.

///
/// Only an explicitly-JSON content type is treated as non-SSE. A missing

///
/// **This deliberately differs from `passthrough_route`'s own `is_sse`,
/// which requires an explicit `text/event-stream`.** They look like the
/// same question and are not, because the populations differ: a passthrough
/// route relays arbitrary REST traffic where most responses are genuinely
/// not SSE, so "unknown means buffer" — the arm that scans — is right
/// there. These typed relays have just asked an LLM provider to stream, so
/// "unknown means stream" is right here, and the cost of being wrong is
/// asymmetric. Guessing "not a stream" turns a working relay whose upstream
/// merely mislabels its content type into a hard `502`, because the
/// buffered arm then parses SSE text as JSON.
///
/// That mislabelling is not hypothetical: eight of this crate's own
/// `/v1/messages` streaming tests produce it by accident. Their mock sets
/// `text/event-stream` and then `set_body_string` overwrites the header
/// with `text/plain` (wiremock `response_template.rs` sets `self.mime`), so
/// they serve a real SSE body under the wrong label — and every one of them
/// fails with a `502` if this predicate demands the correct one.
///
/// The bug this exists for — an upstream ignoring `stream: true` and
/// answering with a JSON document — is caught by the JSON test alone, so
/// the stricter rule would buy nothing for it and cost the above.
///
/// A third sibling, `audio::is_event_stream`, is strict like the
/// passthrough one even though `/v1/audio/transcriptions` is a typed relay
/// that also just asked to stream. That is consistent, not an oversight:
