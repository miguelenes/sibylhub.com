//! `/a2a/:agent` — the downstream-facing A2A gateway endpoint.
//!
//! SibylHub Gateway fronts each registered A2A agent: a caller reaches an agent through
//! `/a2a/<agent>`, and its card is served (with the service URL rewritten to
//! point back at the gateway) at `/a2a/<agent>/.well-known/agent-card.json`.
//! The caller authenticates with an SibylHub Gateway API key — the [`AuthenticatedKey`]
//! extractor rejects a missing or invalid key with `401` before the request
//! reaches the agent. The endpoint is rebuilt from the current configuration
//! snapshot on each request, so it always reflects the live `a2a_agents` set.
//!
//! A `message/send` (and every other JSON-RPC call) is governed by the SAME
//! pipeline as an LLM request, keyed on the caller's API key: per-agent access
//! control (the key's `allowed_agents`), rate-limit + budget (`quota::enforce`),
//! and a usage event into the shared sink. The upstream credential is held
//! gateway-side and never reaches the caller. Guardrails over A2A message
//! content run on the INPUT hook: the caller's message text is screened
//! before the agent is contacted, on the same env / api-key / team scopes
//! an LLM request resolves. `/a2a` carries no model or MCP-server id, so a
//! guardrail attached to one of those scopes does not apply here (the
//! attachment schema says as much) — an env-wide DLP rule does. The OUTPUT
//! hook is not wired: an A2A answer arrives as artifacts and status updates
//! across a stream that may run for hours, and moderating it needs the
//! streamed-output machinery the LLM surfaces have, not a one-shot check.
//!
//! The request body is forwarded verbatim to the upstream agent, so the caller
//! speaks whichever A2A wire version the agent is pinned to; the gateway does
//! not translate between the 0.3 and 1.0 formats here.
//!
//! `message/stream` and `tasks/resubscribe` are relayed as a live SSE stream —
//! each event reaches the caller as the agent pushes it, which is the whole
//! point of those methods: an A2A task runs for minutes or hours and reports
//! progress as it goes. Those calls carry no upstream deadline for the same
//! reason (the unary `timeout_ms` would cut every long task off), so downstream
//! liveness rests on the SSE keep-alive. Their usage event and quota
//! reservation are tied to the stream's real lifetime via a drop guard, so a
//! caller that walks away mid-task is still accounted for.
