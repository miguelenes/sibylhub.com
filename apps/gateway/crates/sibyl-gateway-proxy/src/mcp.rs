//! `/mcp` and `/mcp/{server}` — the downstream-facing MCP gateway endpoints.
//!
//! SibylHub Gateway presents as a single MCP server to a downstream agent: it aggregates
//! the tools of the registered `mcp_servers` and routes tool calls back to
//! them. `/mcp/{server}` scopes the same gateway to one registered server,
//! serving its tools under their original (un-namespaced) names. The caller authenticates with an SibylHub Gateway API key — the
//! [`AuthenticatedKey`] extractor rejects a missing or invalid key with `401`
//! before the request reaches the gateway. The gateway is rebuilt from the
//! current configuration snapshot on each request, so it always reflects the
//! live `mcp_servers` set.
//!
//! A `tools/call` is governed by the SAME pipeline as an LLM request, keyed on
//! the caller's API key: per-tool access control (the layered MCP ACL),
//! rate-limit + budget (`quota::enforce_mcp`, which adds the key's per-MCP-server
//! limit to the shared layers), guardrails on both the tool arguments (input)
//! and the tool result (output), and a usage event into the shared sink.
