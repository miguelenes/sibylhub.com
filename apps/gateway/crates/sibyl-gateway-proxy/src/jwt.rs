//! Inbound OIDC/JWT authentication (AISIX-Cloud#1080, #1081).
//!
//! When the environment has at least one enabled [`OidcProvider`], a bearer
//! token that is a JWT is authenticated here instead of the API-key hash
//! lookup: a trust provider is selected, the signature is verified against
//! that provider's key material, the registered claims (`exp` required,
//! `aud` against the provider's accepted audiences, `nbf` when present)
//! and the provider's `required_scopes` / `bound_claims` are enforced, and
//! the value of the provider's `identity_claim` selects the API key whose
//! `jwt_subject` equals it. The request then proceeds as that key — its
//! `allowed_models`, rate limits, budget, and usage attribution all apply
//! unchanged.
//!
//! A provider verifies in one of two modes, derived from the row rather
//! than declared by it (`OidcProvider::hmac_secret`):
//!
//! - **JWKS mode** — asymmetric signatures verified against keys fetched
//!   from `jwks_uri` or resolved through OIDC discovery, cached, with a
//!   rate-limited refresh when an unknown `kid` appears so key rotation
//!   needs no restart. `issuer` and `audiences` are mandatory.
//! - **HMAC mode** — `HS256`/`HS384`/`HS512` verified against the
//!   provider's shared secret. Nothing is fetched. `issuer` and
//!   `audiences` are optional: set, each is enforced exactly as in JWKS
//!   mode; unset, the corresponding claim is not consulted.
//!
//! Provider selection:
//!
//! 1. A token whose `iss` equals an enabled provider's `issuer` is
//!    verified against **that provider and no other** — a mode or
//!    algorithm mismatch there is a denial, never a fallback.
//! 2. Otherwise (no `iss`, or one matching nothing) the candidates are
//!    the enabled HMAC-mode providers that declare no `issuer`, every
//!    one of them, tried in a deterministic order; the first whose
//!    verification succeeds wins. JWKS-mode providers are never trial
//!    candidates — every one of them pins an issuer.
//!
//! Design invariants:
//!
//! - **No fallback**: once a token is JWT-shaped and JWT auth is enabled,
//!   a validation failure is final — it is never retried as an API key.
//! - **Issuer allow-list**: a JWT whose `iss` names a trust provider is
//!   bound to it; one that names none reaches only the issuer-less
//!   shared-secret providers, and nothing else is a catch-all.
//! - **Default deny**: `exp` is required on every token, as are `iss` and
//!   `aud` wherever the selected provider pins them; a missing identity
//!   claim or an unmapped identity is a rejection, never an anonymous
//!   pass.
//! - **The signature family is pinned per provider**: a JWKS-mode
//!   provider accepts only [`ALLOWED_ALGS`] and an HMAC-mode one only
//!   [`HMAC_ALGS`], checked against the JOSE header before any key
//!   material is built. A public JWKS can therefore never be confused
//!   into acting as a shared secret, and a shared secret can never be
//!   presented as a public key.
//! - Every decision (allow and deny, API-key and JWT path alike) is
//!   recorded on the `sibyl_gateway_auth_decisions_total` metric, and denials are
//!   logged under `target: "sibyl-gateway::auth"` with the detailed reason class —
//!   neither the raw token nor a provider's shared secret is ever logged.
