//! `/v1/realtime` — OpenAI Realtime WebSocket relay (#721,
//! AISIX-Cloud#873 §⑤).
//!
//! Authenticates on connect, resolves the target Model from `?model=`,
//! opens the provider WebSocket and relays frames bidirectionally.
//!
//! The relay is verbatim with one exception, `session.model` — see
//! [`restamp_session_model_out`] and its mirror.
//!
//! ## Protocol scope
//!
//! v1 relays the **OpenAI Realtime wire protocol**: adapter `openai`
//! (api.openai.com and any OpenAI-compatible `api_base`, which covers
//! xAI-style vendors) and `azure-openai` (`{base}/openai/realtime
//! ?api-version=…&deployment=…`, `api-key` header). Gemini Live / AWS
//! Bedrock speak entirely different session/event models and need a
//! cross-protocol translation layer (LiteLLM ships those as dedicated
//! per-provider `transform_realtime_request/response` modules) — that is
//! a separate feature, not part of this endpoint.
//!
//! OpenAI's Realtime API is GA and its GA endpoint **rejects**
//! `openai-beta: realtime=v1` (`beta_api_shape_disabled`), so the
//! gateway does not send it on its own. Beta and GA use different event
//! vocabularies, so the opt-in belongs to the caller that parses those
//! events: a client that sends the beta opt-in — as the `openai-beta`
//! header, or as the `openai-beta.realtime-v1` subprotocol item that the
//! browser flow uses — has it forwarded upstream, and nothing else does.
//!
//! ## Auth
//!
//! Two credential channels, checked before the upgrade completes:
//!
//! 1. `Authorization: Bearer <key>` / `x-api-key` headers — server-side
//!    clients (LiteLLM parity: `user_api_key_auth_websocket`).
//! 2. The `sec-websocket-protocol` item `openai-insecure-api-key.<key>`
//!    — browser clients cannot set headers; this is the documented
//!    OpenAI browser flow. The gateway echoes the `realtime` subprotocol
//!    when offered.
//!
//! Auth/ACL/quota failures reject the HTTP upgrade itself (401/403/429
//! envelope) rather than accept-then-close-1008: same enforcement point,
//! observable to every WS client as a failed handshake.
//!
//! ## Forwarded client headers
//!
//! The ProviderKey's `request.forward_client_headers` applies here as on
//! every other `/v1/*` face: the named headers ride the upstream
//! handshake, and a named credential slot displaces the ProviderKey's own
//! rather than joining it. The handshake slots this surface owns are the
//! one addition to the shared refusals — see [`REALTIME_HANDSHAKE_SLOTS`].
//! `request.default_headers` is a separate feature that this face has
//! never applied.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The relay harvests `response.done` usage frames (and
//! `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed` token usage)
//! from the upstream stream and emits ONE aggregated UsageEvent per
//! session (`inbound_protocol = "realtime"`), committing total tokens to
//! the rate-limit reservation like the other non-chat surfaces (#911
//! [21]).
