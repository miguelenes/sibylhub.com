//! Access-log capture for the tests that pin what a request's ONE line says.
//!
//! A streamed request's line is not written where its handler returns: it is
//! parked on the request's attribution cell and written by whichever
//! terminal emitter ends the request (AISIX-Cloud#1571). That makes "how
//! many lines did this request write, and what did the one line say" a
//! question only a log capture can answer — the value is not returned
//! anywhere a test could read it.
//!
//! [`three_stream_endings`] drives one streaming request through all three
//! endings a stream has, so a family cannot pass the delivered case and
//! silently lose the other two.
