//! Wildcard-aware model resolution (`provider/*` aliases).
//!
//! Client-facing handlers resolve `req.model` through [`resolve_model`] instead
//! of calling `snapshot.models.get_by_name` directly, so a request for
//! `openai/gpt-4o` can be served by an operator-defined `openai/*` wildcard
//! Model. Exact names always win; among wildcards the most specific (longest
//! literal) pattern wins.
//!
//! A wildcard match returns a synthetic clone of the Model with its
//! `model_name` resolved to the concrete upstream id (the captured segment
//! substituted into the template's `*`, or the template kept as-is when it has
//! no `*`). Everything else — id, provider, provider_key_id, rate_limit, cost,
//! guardrail scope — is inherited from the wildcard Model, so downstream
//! dispatch/telemetry treat it like a normal Model and attribution stays on the
//! wildcard Model's id. The client still sees the name it requested, because
//! every handler echoes `req.model` rather than the resolved `display_name`.
