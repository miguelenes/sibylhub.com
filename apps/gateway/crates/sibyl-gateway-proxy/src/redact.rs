//! this module owns WHERE the rewrite is applied on each wire shape:
//!
//! - request side: the normalised [`ChatFormat`] (chat/completions), the
//!   Anthropic-native `/v1/messages` body, the `/v1/responses` body, the
//!   legacy completions `prompt`, and embeddings `input` — message text
//!   only, mirroring the scan surface of `check_input`;
//! - response side: [`ChatResponse`] content + tool-call arguments, the
//!   Anthropic-native response JSON, and buffered streamed chunks
//!   (channel-reassembly: a masked span can cross chunk boundaries, so
//!   each content channel is concatenated, rewritten once, and the full
//!   rewritten text re-emitted on the channel's first chunk).
//!
//! Every helper returns per-detector match counts (detector names only,
//! never values) which callers merge into `usage_events
//! .redacted_entity_counts`.

// ─── Remote segment moderation (kind=bedrock mask write-back) ────────────────
//
// A Bedrock guardrail whose PII action is ANONYMIZE returns the masked
// replacement text from the SAME `ApplyGuardrail` call that yields the
// verdict — an async, whole-request rewrite that can't implement the sync
// per-field redact contract above. The bridge works in three walker
// passes over one wire body, all using the SAME wire-shape walker so slot
// enumeration order is identical by construction:
//
//   1. collect: a probe guardrail records every text slot the walker
//      offers (rewriting nothing);
//   2. one remote call: the chain's segment fold sends the slots as one
//      content block each and returns verdict + positionally-aligned
//      masked texts;
//   3. apply: a second probe guardrail replaces slot i with masked[i].
//
// Call sites pair this with `check_*_non_segment` so a segment-moderating
// member is consulted exactly once per hook. Families without a wire
// walker (embeddings, rerank, images, audio, passthrough, MCP) keep the
// plain `check_*` path, where an ANONYMIZE disposition still maps to
// Block — there is no write-back channel, and releasing the un-masked
// content would defeat the operator's policy.

/// Marker count key [`SegmentApplier`] attaches to each rewritten slot.
/// Several walkers discard a rewrite whose counts are empty (their
/// "did anything change" gate); the marker makes those gates fire. It is
/// never surfaced: [`moderate_body`] discards the apply-walk's returned
/// counts and reports the provider's entity counts instead.
