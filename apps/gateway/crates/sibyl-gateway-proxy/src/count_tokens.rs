//! `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` — Anthropic token-counting passthrough.
//!
//! The Anthropic SDK exposes this as `anthropic.messages.countTokens(...)`,
//! the documented endpoint customers use to size a prompt (messages +
//! system + tools + images) before issuing a paid `/v1/messages` call.
//! Claude Code and most Anthropic-SDK apps call it, so a gateway that
//! omits the route forces callers to over-provision or bypass it (#418).
//!
//! This is the sibling sub-route of `/v1/messages`: same model-alias
//! resolution, same `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version` auth shape, same
//! Anthropic-shape error envelope (#336). The only differences from the
//! `/v1/messages` Anthropic passthrough are the upstream suffix
//! (`/messages/count_tokens`), the absence of streaming, and the tiny
//! `{"input_tokens": <int>}` response, which is forwarded verbatim.
//!
//! Guardrails: the **input** hook runs here, exactly as on `/v1/messages`;
//! the **output** hook does not (#555, revising #545).
//!
//! The two halves are asymmetric because the endpoint is. The response is
//! `{"input_tokens": <int>}` — the provider generated nothing, so an output
//! guardrail has no content to moderate and running one would be theatre.
//! The REQUEST is a different matter: this route ships the caller's entire
//! `system` + `messages` + `tools` payload to the provider, which is
//! precisely the transmission a PII / DLP / data-exfiltration guardrail
//! exists to govern. The original exemption argued the same payload gets
//! scanned when the caller issues the real `/v1/messages` call — but nothing
//! obliges a caller to ever issue it. `count_tokens` on its own is a
//! complete egress channel, and an operator's input policy was silently not
//! applied to it.
//!
//! Mask-action rules rewrite the body here too, before it is forwarded. That
//! also keeps the answer honest: `/v1/messages` masks the same spans, so the
//! count now describes the body the gateway would really send.
//!
//! Telemetry: this route is NOT metered and still emits a terminal
//! `UsageEvent` on every outcome, with `prompt_tokens`/`completion_tokens`
//! at zero. Those are two different questions, and the route answered only
//! the first: it generates nothing, so there is nothing to bill — but it
//! does forward the caller's whole payload to a real upstream, so every
//! question Logs exists to answer (did this request happen, which key sent
//! it, how long did it take, did a guardrail refuse it) had no row to read.
//! A refusal was the sharp end: `/v1/messages/count_tokens` can be blocked
//! by an input guardrail, and a refusal that emits no event is a 422 the
//! caller definitely saw and the "Guardrail blocks" view cannot find
//! (AISIX-Cloud#1435, the same failure mode as AISIX-Cloud#1428).
//! `guardrail_coverage`'s census asserts the reporting half over the
//! surfaces it reads out of the router, so this cannot regress quietly.
//!
//! Scope: Anthropic-backed models only. `count_tokens` has no upstream
//! equivalent for OpenAI/Gemini/DeepSeek, so a non-Anthropic Model is
//! rejected with a 400 at the gateway boundary (parallel to `/v1/rerank`
//! §168 / `/v1/responses` §4.6) rather than dispatched to an upstream
//! that would 404 — and rather than the gateway emitting a misleading
//! 404 of its own, which was the bug this route closes.
//!
//! Reference:
//! - Anthropic Count Message Tokens API:
//!   <https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages-count-tokens>
//!   (`POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` → `{"input_tokens": <int>}`).
//! - Other OpenAI-compatible gateways expose the same route as a
//!   user-facing passthrough and hit the identical "route missing from
//!   the list" bug.
