//! Per-model health tracking for the admin `/admin/v1/health` endpoint.
//!
//! Tracks consecutive upstream failures per model name. The state machine
//! progresses as follows:
//!
//! ```text
//!  Healthy (0) ──[4+ failures]──► Degraded (1) ──[8+ failures]──► Down (2)
//!     ▲                               │                               │
