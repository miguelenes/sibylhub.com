//! sibyl-gateway-ratelimit — two-phase RPM/TPM/concurrency limiter.
//!
//! The proxy middleware calls [`Limiter::pre_commit`] before dispatching
//! a chat request; the returned [`Reservation`] is finalised with
//! [`Reservation::commit_tokens`] after the upstream response completes.
//!
//! Limits come from [`sibyl_gateway_core::RateLimit`] — currently attached to
//! `ApiKey` entries. RPM/RPD are checked-and-incremented up front so
//! burst traffic fails fast; TPM/TPD are checked-only up front and
//! incremented on commit because the token cost is only known after
//! the upstream response lands.
