//! Per-request collection of ENFORCE-mode guardrail hits
//! (AISIX-Cloud#1330 audit chain).
//!
//! Enforcing outcomes were, until this module, visible only as Prometheus
//! aggregates (`GuardrailMetricsSink`, AISIX-Cloud#1076) and — for blocks —
//! as an operator-facing error string. Neither answers the per-request
//! audit question: *which configured policy rewrote or refused THIS
//! request*. Monitor mode already answered it via
//! `UsageEvent::guardrail_monitor_hits`; enforcing mode did not.
//!
//! [`LiveGuardrailIndex::resolve`](crate::LiveGuardrailIndex::resolve)
//! mints one log per resolved chain — and a chain is resolved once per
//! request — so the log's lifetime is the request's. The handler reads it
//! back with [`GuardrailChain::enforced_hits`](crate::GuardrailChain::enforced_hits)
//! when it builds the telemetry event.
//!
//! The same log carries the similarity summaries a `kind: semantic`
//! guardrail produces (AISIX-Cloud#1467). They ride here rather than in a
//! second per-request object because the handle is already threaded to
//! every point that builds a usage event, and a score is recorded on the
//! same executions this log already sees — including the ones that allowed.
//!
//! It also carries the request's fail-open bypass tag, which
//! `usage_events.guardrail_bypassed_reason` is built from. It rides here
//! rather than through a per-handler out-param for the same reason the
//! scores do: this handle is already threaded to every point that builds a
//! usage event, and a bypass is recorded on an execution this log already
//! sees.
//!
//! Names, counts, indices and bounded failure tags only: the matched value,
//! the block reason, the screened text and the example text never enter
//! this log (#153 / #932 no-leak criterion).
