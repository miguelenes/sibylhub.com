//! kind=custom guardrail — screening by an operator-supplied script.
//!
//! The operator writes an ES module; the gateway runs it in a sandboxed
//! engine (quickjs-ng, embedded via rquickjs) once per hook invocation. It
//! exists so a screening service that speaks its own protocol can be reached
//! without deploying a separate adapter in front of it.
//!
//! Script contract:
//!
//! ```js
//! export async function checkInput(ctx)  { /* -> verdict */ }
//! export async function checkOutput(ctx) { /* -> verdict */ }
//! ```
//!
//! `ctx` carries `{ hook, text, segments, messages, model, secrets }`. A
//! verdict is `{ action: "none" }` (or the synonym `{ action: "allow" }`),
//! `{ action: "block", reason, reason_code }`, or `{ action: "mask",
//! segments }` where `segments` is positionally aligned with `ctx.segments`.
//! A hook whose function the module does not export is an Allow, so one
//! script may cover one direction.
//!
//! The vocabulary is CLOSED — [`ACTION_VOCABULARY`] is all of it. A hook
//! that returns anything else, or returns nothing, has not screened the
//! content, so it is a script FAULT and not a decision: `fail_open`
//! settles what happens to the request, and the failure is reported as a
//! fault everywhere an operator looks. It never wears a content block's
//! clothes — not in the caller's error envelope (which says the guardrail
//! could not evaluate the request and carries `error.code =
//! "guardrail_unavailable"`), not in the audit hit (`blocked_unavailable`),
//! and not in the `error_type` on the latency histogram. An operator
//! reading any one of those three can tell "my script is broken" from "my
//! policy is firing", which is the whole point: the two are otherwise the
//! same 422 and the same universal-block symptom.
//!
//! A script can allow, block, OR rewrite. Rewriting rides the same async
//! segment pass the built-in remote redacting kinds use
//! ([`Guardrail::moderate_input_segments`]): the script receives the text
//! slots as `ctx.segments` and returns a replacement per slot. On a call
//! site that cannot substitute text back, a `mask` decision becomes a
//! Block rather than an Allow — releasing the original would honor half
//! the policy, which is the bug class #963 names. Same posture as
//! kind=presidio.
//!
//! Scripts also get the primitives the built-in kinds need in order to
//! reach their own providers, so the kind can express what they express:
//! `crypto` (HMAC-SHA1/SHA256 with chainable key encodings, SHA-1/SHA-256,
//! base64, UUID) for signed provider protocols, and `sibylhub.embed` for
//! semantic screening against the environment's own embedding model
//! through the gateway's provider bridge.
//!
//! **Two independent budgets, because neither covers the other.** The
//! engine's interrupt handler is called while bytecode executes, so it stops
//! a runaway loop but never fires on a script parked on a pending `fetch`.
//! An outer wall-clock timeout catches that case but cannot interrupt a
//! tight loop that never yields. `timeout_ms` arms both.
//!
//! The script is parsed once at chain-build time, WITHOUT being evaluated
//! ([`validate`]) — one parse per chain build rather than one per request,
//! and no operator code runs on the config-apply path.
//!
//! Where the failure first surfaces depends on the entry point, not the
//! source. `sibyl-gateway validate` reports the row through
//! `unbuildable_guardrail_rows` and exits non-zero. A serving gateway logs
//! it and publishes a runtime rejection to `/status/config`, metrics, and
//! managed-mode heartbeats. For an etcd node this may happen on the first
//! request after the snapshot version moves because `LiveGuardrailIndex`
//! rebuilds lazily; its constructor also builds once over the snapshot it
//! already holds. cp-api's own esbuild pass catches the common case at save
//! time.
//!
//! Each invocation gets a brand-new runtime and context (~215µs), so no
//! state survives between requests and the memory ceiling applies per call.
//! The module is re-parsed inside that fresh context rather than reloaded
//! from cached bytecode: this crate is `forbid(unsafe_code)` and
//! `Module::load` is an `unsafe` call, which is not a trade worth making
//! for a parse that costs a fraction of the sandbox it runs in.
//!
//! Behavior matrix. The effective `fail_open` is the outer
//! `Guardrail::fail_open` on the INPUT hook and the independent
//! `CustomConfig::output_fail_open` (default fail-closed) on the OUTPUT hook:
//!
//! | Outcome                                | `fail_open` | Verdict                            |
//! |----------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|
//! | returns `{action:"none"}` / `"allow"`  | n/a         | Allow                              |
//! | hook function not exported             | n/a         | Allow                              |
//! | returns `{action:"block"}`             | n/a         | Block { reason }                   |
//! | returns `{action:"mask"}`              | n/a         | Allow with rewritten segments      |
//! | `mask` where write-back is impossible  | n/a         | Block (never a silent Allow)       |
//! | `mask` with a mismatched slot count    | true        | Bypass { "custom_bad_verdict" }    |
//! | wall-clock budget elapsed              | true        | Bypass { "custom_timeout" }        |
