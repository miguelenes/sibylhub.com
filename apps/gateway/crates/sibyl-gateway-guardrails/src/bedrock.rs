//! kind=bedrock guardrail dispatcher — calls AWS Bedrock's
//! `ApplyGuardrail` API on every chat request and translates the
//! response into a [`GuardrailVerdict`].
//!
//! PRD-09c §6 Phase 2. The cp-api side ships the
//! envelope-encrypted secret; cp-api decrypts at projection time
//! so this module only handles plaintext credentials. We never log
//! the secret.
//!
//! Behavior matrix (failure modes). The effective `fail_open` is the
//! outer `Guardrail::fail_open` on the INPUT hook and the independent
//! `BedrockConfig::output_fail_open` (default fail-closed) on the OUTPUT
//! hook, so a Bedrock outage can't release unscanned model output by
//! default:
//!
//! | Bedrock response                | `fail_open` | Verdict                        |
//! |---------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
//! | `action=NONE`                   | n/a         | Allow                          |
//! | intervened, hard block          | n/a         | Block { reason }               |
//! | intervened, ANONYMIZED only     | n/a         | masked write-back on the segment path (`moderate_*_segments`); Block on the blob path (`check_*`, no write-back channel) |
//! | 5xx / IO error                  | true        | Bypass { "bedrock_5xx" }       |
//! | 5xx / IO error                  | false       | Block { "bedrock unavailable" } |
//! | timeout (`latency_mode=timed`)  | true        | Bypass { "bedrock_timeout" }   |
//! | timeout (`latency_mode=timed`)  | false       | Block { "bedrock timeout" }    |
//! | throttle (4xx ThrottlingException) | true     | Bypass { "bedrock_throttled" } |
//! | throttle                        | false       | Block { "bedrock throttled" }  |
//! | payload refused for its size    | n/a         | re-sent in pieces; only a refusal that cannot be made smaller surfaces, as Bypass { "bedrock_too_large" } / Block |
//!
//! `latency_mode=serial` waits unconditionally — the timeout row
//! never fires.

    // versions encode the URL slightly differently (the v1 shape is
    // POST /guardrail/{id}/version/{ver}/apply); broad path matching
