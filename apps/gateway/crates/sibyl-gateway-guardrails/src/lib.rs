//! sibyl-gateway-guardrails — pluggable content-policy hooks.
//!
//! Two phases per request (spec §6):
//! - **input**: runs after auth + rate-limit but before bridge dispatch
//!   so a blocked prompt never reaches the upstream. A block here also
//!   short-circuits the cache write — no point storing a refusal.
//! - **output**: runs after the upstream response lands, before the
//!   cache write and the JSON render. Lets policies inspect the
//!   model's text and refuse if it crosses a line.
//!
//! Implementations:
//! - [`KeywordBlocklist`] — case-insensitive literal or regex patterns.
//! - [`GuardrailChain`] — composes multiple guardrails; first
//!   [`GuardrailVerdict::Block`] short-circuits.
//! - [`GuardrailIndex`] — P0c: resolves the per-request chain from a
//!   snapshot of guardrail definitions + attachment rows.
