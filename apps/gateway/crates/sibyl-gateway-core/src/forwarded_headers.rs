//! Forwarding inbound client headers to an upstream.
//!
//! Four resources let an operator name headers that must reach the
//! upstream — `provider_key`'s `request.forward_client_headers`, and the
//! same field on `passthrough_route`, `mcp_server` and `a2a_agent` —
//! because the gateway fronts upstreams on four different surfaces and the
//! choice is made per upstream, never gateway-wide: the same deployment
//! reaches internal services that need the caller's own credentials and
//! claims AND public model providers that must never see them.
//!
//! The rule lives here rather than at each call site so every surface
//! answers "may this header be forwarded, and does the pattern name it"
//! the same way — the drift this repo's handler-family rule warns about.
//! The list above is that rule's own census: a new surface belongs in it,
//! or the next reader cannot tell which faces have been checked against a
//! change made here.
//!
//! ## What is blocked, and why only this much
//!
//! Two tiers, and both are deliberately narrow. An operator naming a
//! header on a specific upstream has made a decision about that upstream;
//! a list that second-guesses it just means the capability does not exist
//! for the deployments that need it most (an internal service behind the
//! gateway that authorizes on the end user's own `Authorization`).
//!
//! 1. [`header_forward_blocked`] — headers whose forwarding breaks the
//!    exchange itself ([`NON_FORWARDABLE_HEADERS`]: `host`, and RFC 9110
//!    §7.6.1 hop-by-hop headers, which describe the CALLER's connection and
//!    not the one the gateway opens), or forges a gateway assertion (the
//!    [`GATEWAY_HEADER_PREFIX`] namespace). Absolute, on every surface.
//! 2. [`client_header_forwardable`] — additionally, on the surfaces that
//!    rebuild the outbound message ([`NEVER_FORWARD_FROM_CLIENT`]), the
//!    headers that describe a body this gateway re-serializes or a response
//!    shape it parses. `/passthrough/*` relays the body verbatim and so
//!    does NOT apply this second tier.
//!
//! Credential slots — `authorization`, `x-api-key`, `api-key`,
//! `x-goog-api-key`, `proxy-authorization`, `cookie`, and the AWS SigV4
//! trio `x-amz-security-token` / `x-amz-date` / `x-amz-content-sha256` —
//! are in neither tier on purpose. Handing an internal upstream the end user's own credential,
//! in the slot that upstream already reads, is the capability's whole
//! point, and the surface that injects a gateway credential into the same
//! slot stands aside for it (see each dispatch site).
