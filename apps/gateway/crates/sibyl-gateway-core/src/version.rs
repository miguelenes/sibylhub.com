//! Build-time version identity.
//!
//! Release builds are stamped by CI: the `docker-image` workflow derives
//! `SIBYL_GATEWAY_BUILD_VERSION` from the release tag (`v0.4.0` → `0.4.0`) and
//! passes it as a Docker build-arg, so a released binary always
//! self-reports the version it was tagged with — the `Server` response
//! header, `sibyl-gateway --version`, and the heartbeat `dp_version` all come
//! from here, and no manual `Cargo.toml` bump is required at release
//! time. Local builds (no stamp) fall back to the workspace crate
//! version. (QA v0.3.0 finding: the 0.3.0 image self-reported 0.1.0
//! because the crate version was the only source and was never bumped.)

/// Version the binary reports about itself.
