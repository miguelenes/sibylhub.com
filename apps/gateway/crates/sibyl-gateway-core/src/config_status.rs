//! Load-observability state for the data plane's configuration source.
//!
//! Answers one operator question — *did my configuration take effect, and
//! if not, why?* — for both load paths the gateway supports:
//!
//! - the **etcd** watch source (managed mode), and
//! - the standalone **file** source (`resources_file`).
//!
//! [`ConfigStatus`] is a cheap-to-clone shared handle the load paths update
//! as they observe and apply snapshots. It is read by the non-admin
//! metrics/status listener to serve `GET /status/config`, `GET /status/ready`,
//! and the `sibyl_gateway_config_*` Prometheus series.
//!
//! The etcd supervisor and file source supply loader observations. Runtime
//! builders may add rejections for rows that passed the lenient loader but
//! could not materialise; those are retained independently so a subsequent
//! loader observation cannot erase a still-broken runtime row.
//!
//! ## Reported state
//!
//! [`ConfigState`] is server-derived from the last observed and applied
//! snapshots (see [`ConfigStatusInner::derive_state`]).
//!
//! ## Hash definition
//!
//! `source_hash` and `config_hash` are deterministic and reproducible by a
//! caller that knows what it wrote:
//!
//! - **etcd**: `sha256` over the entries, each rendered as
//!   `key '\0' canonical_json_value '\n'`, concatenated in ascending key
//!   order. `canonical_json_value` recursively sorts object keys and drops
//!   insignificant whitespace ([`canonical_json`]); a value that is not JSON
//!   is hashed as its raw bytes. `source_hash` covers every entry the DP has
//!   observed from etcd — full snapshots and live watch events alike,
//!   including rejected writes. `config_hash` covers the bytes each key
//!   actually *serves*: the observed bytes for accepted keys, the pinned
//!   last-known-good bytes for keys serving stale (#871, see
//!   `serving_stale_since` on `rejected[]`), and nothing for a rejected key
//!   with no last good. When everything is accepted the two hashes are
//!   equal; a rejection makes them diverge, with `rejected[]` (or, for a
//!   `kind` segment this build does not know, `unknown_kinds[]`) as the
//!   authoritative per-resource explanation. A row rejected later by a
//!   runtime builder is removed from the reported count and derives a stable
//!   effective hash from that loader hash plus the sorted rejected identities;
//!   this keeps the source/applied hashes divergent without retaining a second
//!   copy of every source document in the status handle.
//! - **file**: `sha256` over the raw file bytes. On a clean load the applied
//!   `config_hash` equals `source_hash` (the whole file is applied); on a
//!   rejected reload the applied hash stays at the last-good file's hash.
