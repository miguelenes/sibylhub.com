//! Bootstrap configuration loaded from a YAML/TOML/JSON file at startup.

//! Loading order (spec §2):
//! 1. Defaults
//! 2. File contents (path from CLI `--config` or discovery list)
//! 3. Environment-variable overrides (prefix `SIBYL_GATEWAY_`, separator `__`)
//!
//! Example (see `config.example.yaml`):
//!
//! ```yaml
