//! Resolving a document's reference to another Model.
//!
//! Several projected documents point at a Model: a routing target, an
//! ensemble panel member and its judge, a semantic router's embedding
//! model / default / route targets, a cache policy's scope and its
//! semantic embedder, a `kind: semantic` guardrail's embedder. Each was
//! written as a display NAME, which means renaming the referenced model
//! silently breaks every document that named it — the reference resolves
//! to nothing and the site degrades.
//!
//! Every one of those sites now also accepts the referenced model's
//! resource id, resolved through [`resolve_model_ref`]. The id is stable
//! across renames, so the referencing document never has to be rewritten.

use super::GatewaySnapshot;
use std::borrow::Cow;

/// Resolve a model reference written as a display name plus an optional
/// resource id, yielding the name the models table is keyed by.
///
/// The id decides whenever it is present: it is looked up in the models
/// table and the entry's CURRENT display name is returned, so renaming the
/// referenced model takes effect on the next request with no change to the
/// referencing document. `name` is not consulted at all in that case.
/// Resolution happens per request against the live table rather than being
/// cached, and the table is the only input, so nothing derived from an
/// unrelated resource can hold a stale answer.
///
/// An id matching no model yields the id itself. Every caller goes on to
/// look the result up by name and finds nothing — which is exactly what a
/// DANGLING NAME does at the same site. So an unresolvable id degrades the
/// way the site already degrades (a routing target that does not exist, an
/// embedder that cannot be resolved, a cache policy that matches nothing)
/// rather than introducing a failure mode of its own, and in particular
/// never fails the row.
