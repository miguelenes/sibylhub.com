//! Referring to an MCP server by its resource id instead of by its name.
//!
//! Every MCP grant a key or a policy carries used to name its server
//! literally, as the `<server>` half of the namespaced `<server>__<tool>`
//! form the gateway exposes: an `mcp_access` / `mcp_policies` allow or deny
//! pattern, and a per-key MCP rate-limit entry. Renaming a registered server
//! therefore invalidated every document that named it, and the control plane
//! had to rewrite each of them.
//!
//! Each of those sites now also accepts the server's resource id, with the
//! tool still named. The id survives a rename, so the referencing document
//! never has to be rewritten — and because the client-facing namespace is
//! still the server's CURRENT name, a rename changes what callers type and
//! nothing else.
