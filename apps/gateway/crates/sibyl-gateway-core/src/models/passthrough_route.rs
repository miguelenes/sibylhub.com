//! `PassthroughRoute` entity — an explicit passthrough binding from a

//!
//! Replaces the removed implicit `/passthrough/:provider/*rest` tunnel: the
//! route names its own upstream and credential handling instead of borrowing
//! them from "the first accessible Model of the provider", so there is no
//! implicit-selection ambiguity (AISIX-Cloud#1127) and no forced credential
//! replacement (AISIX-Cloud#1312).

//! etcd path: `{prefix}/passthrough_routes/{uuid}`. Secondary index on `name`.
