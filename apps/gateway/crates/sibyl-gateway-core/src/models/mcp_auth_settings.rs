//! `McpAuthSettings` entity — how the environment authenticates callers
//! of `/mcp`, stored in etcd under `mcp_auth_settings/<uuid>` (the
//! control plane keys the singleton row by the environment id).
//!
//! Two independent settings live here, both optional and both off
//! without the row:
//!
//! - `resource_url` activates the `/mcp` OAuth 2.1 resource-server
//!   discovery surface (AISIX-Cloud#1143) when at least one enabled
//!   [`OidcProvider`](super::oidc_provider::OidcProvider) also exists:
//!   the RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata document is served under
//!   `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, and `/mcp` auth failures
//!   carry a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge pointing at it.
//! - `anonymous` lets callers that present NO credential at all reach
//!   named MCP entries as a bound API-key principal (AISIX-Cloud#1313).
//!   An invalid, expired or disabled credential is still rejected —
//!   anonymous is the no-credential path, never a downgrade.
//!
//! Both are absent by default, so an environment without the row keeps
//! the pre-#1143 behavior byte for byte: every `/mcp` request needs a
//! valid gateway credential and no discovery surface is published.
//!
//! At most one row exists per environment. The declarative resources
//! file rejects a document carrying more than one entry at load, and the
//! runtime resolvers fail closed if a duplicate reaches a live snapshot
//! anyway (a stale etcd key), rather than picking one by id order.
