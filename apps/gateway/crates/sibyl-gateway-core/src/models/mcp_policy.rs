//! `McpPolicy` entity — environment-level and team-level MCP tool access
//! policies stored in etcd under `mcp_policies/<uuid>`.
//!
//! MCP tool access is resolved from up to three layers of the same shape,
//! each an `allow`/`deny` pattern pair: the `env`-scoped policy, the
//! `team`-scoped policy of the key's team, and the key's own `mcp_access`
//! block. A tool is permitted when **every present layer** allows it and
//! **no** layer denies it — allow intersects, deny unions. A layer that is
//! absent (no policy row, a disabled one, or no `mcp_access` block) imposes
//! no constraint; with no layer present at all the grant is empty, so MCP
//! access is always granted explicitly.
//!
//! Because `allow` is required on every layer, a layer that only wants to
//! subtract tools spells its allow side `["*"]`. The effective-ACL
//! computation lives with the MCP gateway endpoint, which resolves it per
//! request.
