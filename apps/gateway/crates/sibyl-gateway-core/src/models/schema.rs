//! JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 validators for every entity written via the
//! Admin API (spec §2, §3).
//!
//! The flow on write is:
//! ```text
//! 1. parse bytes as serde_json::Value
//! 2. validator.validate(&value)       → emits detailed field path on failure
//! 3. serde deserialise into the typed struct (cheap after schema passes)
//! 4. duplicate-name check vs snapshot
//! 5. etcd txn commit
//! ```
//!
//! Two validator sets exist since issue #871 (strict write / lenient read):
//!
//! - **Strict** ([`SCHEMAS`], the plain `validate_*` functions): unknown
//!   fields are rejected (where a resource closes them). Used by the
//!   in-repo declarative writers — `sibyl-gateway validate` and the file
//!   source — so typos keep failing loud, and published as the
//!   resource schema files in `schemas/resources/` — the write
//!   contract. (The control plane validates against its own API
//!   schema; raw direct etcd puts are only checked on read.)
//! - **Lenient** ([`LENIENT_SCHEMAS`], the `validate_*_lenient` functions):
//!   unknown fields pass; every other constraint (types, required, ranges,
//!   closed enums) still applies. Used only by the etcd snapshot loader so a
//!   document written by a newer control plane loads with its extra fields
//!   ignored — and reported — instead of whole-row rejected.
//!
//! Both sets build from the same per-resource producers; strictness is a
//! mechanical pair of passes over the produced value — [`close_unknown_fields`]
//! for the write set, [`open_unknown_fields`] for the read set — so the two
//! can never drift field-wise. Every closure, whether the write pass placed it
//! or a producer injected it by hand (the `observability_exporter` and
//! guardrail kind branches, the guardrail tagged sub-enums, the untagged
//! `ConditionNode`/`OnEmbeddingFailure` variants), belongs to the write set
//! alone: the read pass strips `additionalProperties: false` at EVERY depth,
//! so an optional field a newer control plane added inside a nested config
//! object is ignored instead of taking the whole row down with it.
//!
//! Tolerated is not the same as silent. Unknown fields inside serde-buffered
//! content — everything under the guardrail/exporter `#[serde(flatten)]`ed
//! tagged config, or inside an untagged variant — never reach
//! `serde_ignored`, so the loader takes their paths from
//! [`unknown_field_paths`], which reads them off the strict schema.
//!
//! The watch path reuses step 2 on incoming events — malformed payloads are
//! skipped with a warning and do not take down the gateway.

///    buffered `Content`: a type-level `deny` there applied to the etcd READ
///    path as well, where it killed every row whose control plane had added
///    a field, and it was invisible in the published schema besides. The
///    write contract is expressed instead by closing every struct-shaped
///    definition and every kind branch — the shared root properties are
///    copied into each branch first, since a closed branch lists only its own
///    kind's fields while the document also carries `name`, `enabled`,
///    `hook_point`, … from the flattened parent. Allowed = root fields ∪
///    `kind` ∪ that kind's fields: exactly what serde enforced, now on the
///    write path only ([`open_unknown_fields`] strips it for the loader).
/// 2. The tagged sub-enums (`KeywordPattern`/`BedrockAWSCredentials`/
///    `BedrockLatencyMode`) lose `deny_unknown_fields` in their `oneOf`
///    branches, so each is re-closed with `additionalProperties: false`.
/// 3. The stringly-typed moderation fields carry closed sets the hand-written
///    schema enforced via `enum`. They stay `String` on the struct (their
///    values flow through `sibyl-gateway-guardrails` as strings; converting them to
///    Rust enums would churn that crate's processing), so the closed set is
///    injected here into the relevant property.
/// 4. `schemars` leaves discriminator tag fields and collection item schemas
///    without descriptions, so the public schema fills those gaps.
/// 5. `created_at` republishes its `date-time` format (annotation-only).
