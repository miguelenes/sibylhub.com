//! Connection-layer settings and error rendering for upstream HTTP calls.
//!
//! Every provider bridge talks to its upstream through a `reqwest::Client`.
//! Two things live here because they must be identical across all of them:
//!
//! - [`client_builder`] — a `ClientBuilder` pre-loaded with the process-wide
//!   connection settings ([`UpstreamHttpConfig`]). reqwest's own defaults
//!   leave TCP keepalive off, impose no connect timeout, and keep idle
//!   pooled connections for 90s — longer than the idle timeout of a typical
//!   LB/NAT/proxy hop in front of a provider, so a pooled connection can be
//!   reaped upstream and still be handed out here, failing the next request.
//! - [`transport_error_message`] — renders a `reqwest::Error` with its full
//!   `source()` chain. The top-level `Display` is only ever
//!   "error sending request for url (…)", which is the same string for a DNS
//!   failure, a TCP reset, a TLS handshake error, and a stale pooled
//!   connection. The chain is what tells them apart.
