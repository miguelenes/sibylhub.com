//! The one place outbound headers that are **not** owned by the gateway get
//! added to a standard-protocol upstream request.
//!
//! Two operator-facing features share this pipeline, in this order:
//!
//! 1. `request.default_headers` — static headers the ProviderKey injects,
//!    with `${...}` request-context variables rendered per request
//!    (AISIX-Cloud#1112).
//! 2. `request.forward_client_headers` — inbound client headers matching an
//!    operator-configured allowlist, forwarded verbatim
//!    (AISIX-Cloud#1167).
//!
//! **`default_headers` defers to the gateway; `forward_client_headers`
//! does not.** Every caller inserts its own bridge-owned headers (auth,
//! `content-type`, `x-sibylhub-request-id`, streaming `accept`) into the
//! `HeaderMap` *first*, and the `default_headers` merge declines a name
//! that is already present — a static operator value never displaces the
//! gateway's own. A FORWARDED CLIENT header does displace it, because the
//! operator named that header on this specific upstream and the slot they
//! most often name is the credential one: handing an internal service the
//! caller's own `Authorization` in place of the gateway's is the whole
//! reason the field exists. `insert` rather than `append`, so exactly one
//! credential reaches the wire and the upstream never picks between two
//! (the #411 shape). Between the two operator features, `default_headers`
//! resolves first, so an operator's static header beats a client header of
//! the same name — everywhere but a credential slot, where the forward is
//! the whole reason the field exists and takes the slot from the static
//! entry too.
//!
//! What can never be forwarded is narrow and lives in
//! `sibyl_gateway_core::forwarded_headers`: the transport slots whose forwarding
//! breaks the exchange, the gateway's own `x-sibylhub-*` namespace, and — on
//! this pipeline, which REBUILDS the outbound message — the headers that
//! describe a body the gateway re-serializes or a response shape it
//! parses.
//!
//! Before #1167 the standard endpoints rebuilt the outbound header set from
//! scratch and dropped every client header — the default this module
//! preserves. `/passthrough/*` is the opposite policy (forward everything
//! except `pk.strip_headers`) and does not use this pipeline; there
//! `forward_client_headers` overrides the strip instead.
