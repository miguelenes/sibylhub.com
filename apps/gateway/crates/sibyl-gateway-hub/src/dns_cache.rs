//! One in-process answer per upstream hostname, shared by every outbound
//! client.
//!
//! Without it each new connection resolves its own name. That is invisible
//! in steady state, because a warm pool opens almost no connections, and
//! decisive when the pool is cold: a gateway resuming from a pause finds
//! every queued request without an idle connection, opens one per request,
//! and pays a `getaddrinfo` for each — 314 at once in the case this was
//! built for, each on its own blocking-pool thread, and under a cluster
//! resolver's `ndots:5` search list about ten DNS packets per lookup. The
//! answers were never lost; the stampede itself was the cost, on a core a
//! request worker also wanted.
//!
//! Two things fix that, and both are here: concurrent lookups of one name
//! collapse into one, and its answer is reused briefly afterwards.
//!
//! **The reuse window is wall-clock, not the record's own TTL.** The
//! platform resolver does not report a TTL — `getaddrinfo` has nowhere to
//! put one — so honouring it would mean resolving DNS ourselves instead of
//! asking the system, which would also take over the search list, the
//! hosts file and nsswitch. Mainstream gateways in this space cache the
//! same way, on a fixed window, for the same reason. [`ANSWER_TTL`] is
//! deliberately far shorter than theirs: a provider addressed through a
//! cluster Service changes address when its endpoints rotate, and a long
//! window means dialling a dead address until it expires.
