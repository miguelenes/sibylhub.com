//!   [`crate::upstream_http::client_builder`];
//! - rmcp's own `reqwest` line (MCP streamable-http), which is a
//!   different crate version and so needs the raw PEM, not our parsed
//!   `reqwest::Certificate`;
//! - raw rustls (the Realtime WebSocket) via [`rustls_client_config`];
//! - the AWS SDK (Bedrock) via [`extra_ca_pem`] — see the note on
//!   [`TlsSettings::verify`] for the one knob that stack cannot express.
//!
//! Everything here is *additive to* the platform trust store, which
//! stays whatever `SSL_CERT_FILE` / `SSL_CERT_DIR` and the system bundle
//! make it. Trusting a private CA never removes trust in a public one.
