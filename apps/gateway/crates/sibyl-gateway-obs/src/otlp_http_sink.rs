//! Per-env OTLP/HTTP exporter — emits one OTLP-shaped span per chat request
//! to each configured `ObservabilityExporter` (kind=otlp_http).
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! cp-api projects every configured exporter onto kine at
//! `/sibyl-gateway/<env>/observability_exporters/<uuid>`. The DP loads them via the
//! existing etcd watch into `GatewaySnapshot::observability_exporters`. After
//! every chat completion the proxy hot path hands the resulting `UsageEvent`
//! plus the live snapshot's exporter list to [`OtlpHttpFanOut::fan_out`],
//! which:
//!
//! 1. Filters to enabled exporters with `kind = OtlpHttp`.
//! 2. Resolves each exporter's [`crate::sink::SinkPipeline`] (lazily started
//!    on first sighting, immediately consistent with the snapshot) and
//!    enqueues one OTLP span record into it. The pipeline batches, retries
//!    transient failures with backoff, and drops-with-metric under
//!    backpressure — all off the request hot path. Spans are encoded per
//!    OpenTelemetry's GenAI semantic conventions
//!    (<https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md>).
//!
//! ## Per-exporter knobs (#519 B.2)
//!
//! - **`sample_rate`** — fraction of requests exported, decided per REQUEST
//!   from a deterministic FNV-1a hash of `request_id` (absent = 1.0). The
//!   decision happens at fan-out time, before any pipeline work, so a
//!   dropped request enqueues nothing for that exporter; and because every
//!   attempt span of one request shares the `request_id`, a trace is
//!   exported whole or not at all — consistently across retries/fallbacks.
//! - **`content_mode` / `content_max_bytes`** — same opt-in content capture
//!   the SLS / Datadog sinks use ([`content_record`]); under `full` the span
//!   carries `gen_ai.prompt` / `gen_ai.completion` (plus
//!   `sibyl-gateway.content_truncated` when cut) — the same keys the Datadog sink
//!   ships the captured content under. Defaults to `metadata_only`, where
//!   the record never carries content fields, so it cannot leak.
//!
//! ## What's intentionally NOT here yet
//!
//! - **No gRPC** — `otlp_grpc` is a separate kind we'll add when a user
//!   actually asks for it; the JSON-over-HTTP form works against every
//!   receiver in the wild and avoids pulling in tonic on the hot path.
