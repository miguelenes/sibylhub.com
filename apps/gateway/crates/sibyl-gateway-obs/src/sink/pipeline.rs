//! The shared, per-sink delivery pipeline.
//!
//! Generalises the proven `sibyl-gateway-server` telemetry worker (bounded mpsc →
//! batch → flush) into a reusable component every sink runs behind, and adds
//! what telemetry deliberately skipped: retry with exponential backoff and
//! drop-with-metric backpressure. One pipeline per sink, so a slow or down
//! sink can never stall another or the request hot path.
//!
//! Division of labour: the pipeline owns *flow control* — a bounded queue,
//! count/time batching, retry/backoff and drop accounting. The sink owns
//! *wire encoding*, including chunking a batch down to its own per-request
//! byte limit inside `append_batch` (only the sink knows the encoded size).
