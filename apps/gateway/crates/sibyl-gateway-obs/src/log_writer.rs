//! A bounded, lossy log sink: the request path never blocks on logging.
//!
//! The subscriber used to hand each formatted event straight to
//! `std::io::stderr`, from whatever thread produced it. In a container
//! that descriptor is a 64 KiB pipe to the runtime's log shim, and when
//! the shim stops draining it — kubelet rotating and gzipping the
//! container log is the routine cause, at this gateway's log volume every
//! ~40 seconds — the pipe fills and `write` blocks. With one request
//! worker per core that blocks the worker: measured on the benchmark
//! gateway, the only request thread sat in `pipe_write` for 0.65 s with
//! the process at 0.00 CPU, `/livez` took 663 ms, and every request in
//! flight finished in one burst when the pipe drained.
//!
//! So events go into a fixed-size queue and one dedicated thread drains
//! it. When the queue is full the NEW event is dropped — the alternative,
//! blocking the producer, is the bug. Drops are counted in
//! `sibyl_gateway_log_lines_dropped_total` and, once the sink catches up, stated
//! once in a warning; a gap in the log that the log itself does not
//! account for would be worse than the gap.
//!
//! Two things deliberately stay synchronous. A panic still goes straight
//! to stderr, because the default panic hook writes there itself rather
//! than through the subscriber — nothing here may change that, though it
//! is worth knowing that a panic raised while the sink is stuck queues
//! behind the same descriptor lock the writer thread holds, exactly as it
//! did before any of this. And `shutdown` is called on the way out of
//! `main`, so a graceful exit empties the queue before the process goes.
