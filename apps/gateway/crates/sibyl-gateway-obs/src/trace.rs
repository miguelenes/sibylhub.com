//! Request-owned trace identity for the OTLP export path (AISIX-Cloud#1279).
//!
//! Before this module every exported span minted fresh random trace/span
//! ids inside the encoder — which runs inside the sink pipeline's retry
//! loop, so a transient delivery failure re-encoded the batch and a
//! receiver that dedups on span id saw N distinct spans for one attempt.
//! And with every span its own root, the per-attempt events of one
//! request (#655) joined only on the `sibyl-gateway.request_id` attribute, which
//! no trace waterfall understands.
//!
//! The fix is ownership: a [`RequestTraceBundle`] is minted ONCE per
//! request (by the proxy's request-id middleware, the same single mint
//! point the request id itself uses), carries the trace id, the SERVER
//! span id, the logical GenAI span id and one span id per upstream
//! attempt, and rides into the sink layer as an immutable
//! [`TraceEmission`] snapshot on each record — so a delivery retry
//! re-encodes byte-identical ids, and every exporter sees the same trace.
//!
//! Wire vocabulary follows W3C Trace Context Level 1
//! (<https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/>): `traceparent` version 00,
//! 16-byte trace id / 8-byte parent id, lowercase hex. Ingestion is
//! strict — anything malformed degrades to a locally-rooted trace and the
//! caller's `tracestate` is discarded with it, so an upstream proxy that
//! mangles the header can never smuggle a zero id or mixed-case hex into
//! the export.
