//! sibyl-gateway-obs — observability primitives shared by the proxy and admin
//! crates.
//!
//! Scope for PR #14:
//! - [`init_tracing`] installs the process-wide tracing subscriber.
//! - [`access_log::AccessLog`] — one-line structured request log, called
//!   by the proxy handler at end-of-request.
//! - [`metrics::Metrics`] — Prometheus counters + histogram for
//!   requests/duration/rate-limits/tokens.
//! - [`sink`] — pluggable observability-sink framework: the
//!   capability-typed [`sink::ObservabilitySink`] adapter contract
//!   (AISIX-Cloud#692).
