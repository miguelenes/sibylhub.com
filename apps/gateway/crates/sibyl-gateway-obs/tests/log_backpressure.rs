//! The production logging path against a consumer that stops reading.
//!
//! This is the defect in its original shape: a child process installs the
//! real subscriber, its stderr is a pipe, and the parent does not read
//! that pipe. The pipe fills, the sink blocks, and the child keeps
//! logging. What must come out the other side is the log the queue could
//! hold plus one line saying how much was lost — and the child must reach
//! its own exit rather than sit in `write`.
//!
//! A separate binary, and a separate process, because `init_tracing`
//! installs a process-global subscriber exactly once.
