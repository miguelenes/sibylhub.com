//! Surviving an etcd auth token the server no longer accepts.
//!
//! `etcd-client` authenticates once, inside `Client::connect`, and never
//! again. The token it gets there is the only one that connection will
//! ever carry, and etcd stops accepting it in two ordinary situations:
//!
//! 1. **The token's TTL elapses.** Answered `Unauthenticated`
//!    (`etcdserver: invalid auth token`).
//! 2. **The auth store's revision changes** — someone runs `etcdctl user
//!    add`, grants a role, edits a permission. Every token issued before
//!    that is refused from the moment it lands, and answered
//!    `InvalidArgument` (`etcdserver: revision of auth store is old`),
//!    sharing a status code with a wrong password.
//!
//! Every later call is then refused, and before this the only cure was
//! restarting the gateway. Note what is *not* on the list: an etcd
//! restart on its own does not invalidate anything, because
//! `Authenticate` is a raft entry and replaying the WAL re-registers the
//! tokens it minted.
//!
//! Both need a server that really issues and forgets tokens — the status
//! code, the wording and the *timing* are etcd's, not something a stub
//! can stand in for. Bracketed by `ETCD_AUTH_TTL_TEST_URL` (the pattern
//! `auth_connect_integration.rs` uses): the tests no-op when it is unset,
//! so a local `cargo test` without docker still passes. CI starts the
//! cluster and sets the variables in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
//!
//! The cluster this file uses is a **third** etcd, separate from the
//! `ETCD_AUTH_TEST_URL` one, for two reasons. Its token lifetime is
//! seconds rather than the five-minute default, which would make every
//! other authenticated test depend on this feature. And it runs
//! `--auth-token jwt` rather than the default `simple`, which is what
//! reaches case 2 above: under `simple` the auth revision is read at
//! request time, so only JWT — what a multi-member cluster runs anyway —
//! refuses a token for it.
//!
//! The container and short-TTL cluster this needs were built by community
//! PR api7/sibyl-gateway#763 (`okaybase`), which proposed the scheduled-refresh
//! fix these tests replace.
