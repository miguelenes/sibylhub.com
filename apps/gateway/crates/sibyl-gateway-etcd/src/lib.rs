//! sibyl-gateway-etcd — etcd-backed [`ConfigProvider`] + watch supervisor.
//!
//! The gateway's hot read path talks to a `SnapshotHandle<GatewaySnapshot>`
//! (see `sibyl-gateway-core`). This crate is what *populates* that handle, running
//! a single supervisor task that:
//!
//! 1. Connects to etcd — an etcd that cannot be reached is left to this
//!    loop rather than failing the boot; credentials it refuses are fatal
//! 2. Performs a full range read under the configured prefix
//! 3. Opens a watch stream from the next revision
//! 4. Applies Put / Delete events by copy-on-write replacing the snapshot
//! 5. Triggers a full resync on compaction
//! 6. Reconnects with exponential backoff (1→60s) on transport failure
//!
//! The [`ConfigProvider`] trait is the seam tests use to plug in an
//! in-memory provider and avoid a container dependency for unit testing.
//!
//! Spec references: §2 (config system), §3 (data models).
