//! Watch supervisor — the single long-running task that owns the
//! [`ConfigProvider`] and keeps an [`GatewaySnapshot`] current in a
//! [`SnapshotHandle`].
//!
//! Responsibilities (spec §2):
//! 1. Initial `load_all` + publish first snapshot
//! 2. Open a watch stream from the load revision
//! 3. Apply Put/Delete events incrementally on top of the current
//!    snapshot (building a *new* snapshot each time so reads stay
//!    lock-free)
//! 4. On compaction or stream error, full-reload + resync
//! 5. Reconnect with exponential backoff (1→60s) on transport failure
//!
//! The apply step is *copy-on-write* per batch: we clone the current
//! snapshot into a new one, mutate, and `store` it. That keeps the
//! read path reading a fully-formed `Arc<Snapshot>` the whole time.
