//! The etcd read path, end to end, for a guardrail written by a control
//! plane one release ahead of this binary.
//!
//! The supported upgrade order puts the control plane in front of its data
//! planes, so for the length of that window a released — and therefore
//! unchangeable — data plane reads documents that carry fields it has never
//! heard of. An optional field is supposed to cost an entry in the
//! partial-compat report and nothing else. For anything nested inside a
//! guardrail's config it used to cost the whole row instead, which for a
//! content policy means it stops enforcing: PII flows through unmasked
//! until the data plane is upgraded. This pins the loader and the guardrail
//! build together, because either one alone can still drop the row.
