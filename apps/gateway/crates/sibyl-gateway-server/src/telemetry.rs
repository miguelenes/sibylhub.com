//! Sender worker for the CP-side `/dp/telemetry` surface.
//!
//! Per prd-09a §9A.7B Phase 1:
//!
//! - Proxy handlers call [`UsageSink::try_emit`] (defined in sibyl-gateway-obs)
//!   to push one event per chat completion onto an mpsc channel.
//! - This worker drains the channel, batches up to [`MAX_BATCH`]
//!   events or every [`FLUSH_INTERVAL`] (whichever fires first),
//!   POSTs the batch as `{ events: [...] }` to the CP's
//!   `/dp/telemetry` URL, and logs the outcome.
//! - On HTTP error the batch is re-sent — but only while the control
//!   plane's own answer proves re-sending cannot double-count. Every
//!   POST carries [`USAGE_BATCH_ID_HEADER`], the control plane records
//!   that id in the same transaction as the usage rows, and it answers
//!   every response from that handler with [`USAGE_BATCH_DEDUP_HEADER`].
//!   A failure whose response lacks that header — or carries it with an
//!   undefined value — is dropped, exactly as every failure was before.
//!   There is still no persistent disk queue: a batch is given up on once
//!   its OLDEST event is [`RETRY_BUDGET`] old (which can be before its
//!   first attempt, since the sender is single in-flight), or once the
//!   control plane has answered and refused it [`MAX_ANSWERED_FAILURES`]
//!   times in a row. The `received_at` column on the cp-api side records
//!   when CP saw the row, so dashboards distinguish "DP never sent" from
//!   "DP sent but CP rejected" via log correlation.
//!
//! mTLS: the sender presents the same on-disk bundle the heartbeat
//! worker uses. cp-api derives `env_id` and `dp_id` from the peer
//! cert SAN URI, so the request body doesn't carry them — same wire
//! shape as `/dp/heartbeat`.
