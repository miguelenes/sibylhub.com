/// settable via `default_headers` — the bridge's SigV4 signer
/// computes them per-request from the canonical request, and an
/// operator-supplied override would invalidate the signature.
///
/// Unlike every other upstream, where naming a credential slot is the
/// point of `default_headers` / `forward_client_headers`, these are
/// DERIVED by the signer from the request it signs — a configured value
/// authenticates nobody here. `filtered_extra_headers` drops them with a
