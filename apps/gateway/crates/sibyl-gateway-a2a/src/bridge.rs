//! The upstream A2A client, behind the [`A2aBridge`] trait.
//!
//! A bridge targets one upstream agent and exposes just the two operations the
//! gateway needs in this first cut: fetch the agent's card, and forward a
//! JSON-RPC request to it. Aggregating bridges behind the downstream-facing
//! `/a2a/<agent>` endpoint, agent-card URL rewriting, and wiring into the
//! shared guardrail/quota pipeline come in later steps — this layer only proves
//! a governed tunnel to one real upstream.
//!
//! The upstream credential is held here on the gateway side and is never
//! exposed to the calling client, which presents only its SibylHub Gateway key.
//!
//! Wire references (verified against the A2A specification):
//! - Agent card discovery: the RFC 8615 well-known URI
//!   `https://{domain}/.well-known/agent-card.json`. The spec resolves it at the
//!   origin, but real deployments also publish it under the agent's own path
//!   prefix, so both bases are tried — see [`HttpBridge::agent_card_urls`].
//!   <https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/topics/agent-discovery/>
//! - Every request announces the wire version it speaks in the `A2A-Version`
//!   header; an agent that receives none must assume `0.3`. The version is
//!   pinned per agent on the `A2aAgent` resource.
//! - `message/send` is a JSON-RPC 2.0 method whose envelope differs between the
//!   A2A 0.3 and 1.0 wire formats. This bridge forwards the caller's request
//!   verbatim and does not translate between versions, so the method name and
//!   body shape are the caller's concern, not this layer's.
