//! Reading the protocol-level facts of an A2A call out of its JSON-RPC
//! envelopes: which operation was invoked, and which task / context / task
//! state the call touched.
//!
//! The gateway forwards A2A bodies verbatim (see [`crate::bridge`]), so an
//! operator running a mix of agents sees BOTH wire vocabularies on the same
//! endpoint: an agent pinned to 0.3 is called with `message/send`, one pinned
//! to 1.0 with `SendMessage`, and those are the same operation. Everything
//! here exists to record one fact once — a canonical operation name, a task
//! id, a task state — regardless of which version produced it.
//!
//! Wire references:
//! - Methods: the 1.0 RPC names (`SendMessage`, `GetTask`, …) are section 9.4
//!   of the specification; the `message/send`-style names are their 0.3
//!   spelling. <https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/>
//! - `TaskState`: the 1.0 enum is `TASK_STATE_<NAME>`; its 0.3 wire string is
//!   the name lowercased with `_` → `-`, which is why [`normalize_task_state`]
//!   needs no per-value table.
//! - A `Task` carries `id`, `contextId` and `status.state`; the streaming
//!   update events carry `taskId` / `contextId` instead. Both shapes are read
//!   by [`A2aCallFacts::observe_result`].
