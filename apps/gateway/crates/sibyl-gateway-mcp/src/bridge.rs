//! The upstream MCP client, behind the [`McpBridge`] trait.
//!
//! A bridge owns one live MCP session to a single upstream server (Streamable
//! HTTP transport) and exposes just the two operations the gateway needs in
//! this first cut: enumerate the server's tools, and invoke one. Aggregating
//! many bridges into the downstream-facing `/mcp` endpoint, tool namespacing,
//! and wiring into the shared guardrail/quota pipeline come in later steps —
//! this layer only proves a governed tunnel to one real upstream.
//!
//! All `rmcp` types are converted to this crate's own DTOs at the boundary so
//! the rest of the data plane never depends on the SDK directly. That keeps
//! rmcp's still-moving API contained to this file.

/// - a connect timeout exists at all (rmcp sets none, so a black-holed

/// - connection POOLING turns ON. rmcp deliberately disables idle
///   pooling (`pool_max_idle_per_host(0)`) to dodge ~40 ms delayed-ACK
///   stalls on reused connections; here reuse wins — every other
///   outbound path pools under `upstream.*` management, and per-call
///   TCP+TLS handshakes to a remote MCP server cost far more than the
///   stall rmcp avoids. An operator can restore rmcp's behaviour with
