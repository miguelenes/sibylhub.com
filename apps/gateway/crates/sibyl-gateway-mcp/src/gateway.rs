//! The downstream-facing MCP gateway endpoint.
//!
//! [`McpGateway`] makes SibylHub Gateway look like a single MCP server to a downstream
//! agent while fronting N registered upstream servers (each an [`McpBridge`]).
//! It is the other half of the dual role: an MCP *client* to each upstream
//! (via [`crate::RmcpBridge`]) and an MCP *server* to the agent (this type,
//! served over Streamable HTTP by [`streamable_http_service`]).
//!
//! Two operations, mirroring the upstream surface:
//! - `tools/list` fans out across every upstream and returns one aggregated
//!   list, each tool namespaced `server<SEP>tool`. An upstream that fails to
//!   list is skipped (its tools are simply absent), so one bad upstream does
//!   not blind the agent to the rest.
//! - `tools/call` strips the namespace prefix and routes to the owning
//!   upstream.
//!
//! A gateway may instead be **scoped** to a single upstream
//! ([`McpGateway::from_snapshot_scoped`], mounted at `/mcp/{server}`): it then
//! serves that server's tools under their original, un-namespaced names while
//! ACL decisions keep evaluating the namespaced form.
//!
//! The aggregator holds no per-session state, so governance never depends on
//! a transport session — which keeps it aligned with the stateless direction
//! of the MCP 2026-07-28 revision. Its only per-request state is the
//! [`ToolsListCounts`] slot a `tools/list` fills in for the mount's access
//! log, and a gateway is built per request.
//!
//! Wiring this endpoint behind the gateway's auth / per-tool ACL / quota /
//! observability pipeline (and sourcing upstreams from the resource snapshot)
//! is the next step; this type takes an explicit set of upstreams and is not
//! yet mounted on any production listener.
